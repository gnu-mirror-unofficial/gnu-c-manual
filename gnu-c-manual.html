<H1><A NAME="SEC1">Preface</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>


<P>
This is a reference manual for the GNU C programming language (C as implemented
by the GNU C compiler), and is currently <STRONG>IN PROGRESS</STRONG>.  This version of
the manual is <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> the finished work.


<P>
Most of this current draft was written by Trevis Rothwell, with some parts
by Richard Stallman.




<H1><A NAME="SEC2">Lexical Elements</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>


<P>
This chapter describes the components that make up the source code
for a C program.  You will most likely be writing your source code
using the ASCII character set or the Unicode character set, but you
could also use the ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code set, along with
trigraph sequences.  All sample code in this manual was created
using the ASCII character set.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3">Tokens</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>


<P>
Tokens are the basic lexical elements of a C program.  Anything
other than white space and comments is considered a token.  There
are six different kinds of tokens, all of which are described in the
following sections.




<H3><A NAME="SEC4">Identifiers</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>


<P>
Identifiers are strings of characters used for naming variables,
functions, new data types, and preprocessor macros.  The characters
can be letters, decimal digits, the underscore character <SAMP>`_'</SAMP>,
or the dollar sign character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  The first character of an
identifier cannot be a digit.  Lowercase letters and uppercase letters
are distinct, so <CODE>squid</CODE> and <CODE>Squid</CODE> are two different
identifiers.




<H3><A NAME="SEC5">Keywords</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>


<P>
Keywords are identifiers that are reserved for use by the programming
language itself, and may not be used in any other way.  Here is a list
of GNU C keywords:

<H3><A NAME="SEC6">Constants</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>


<P>
A constant is a literal numeric or character value, such as
5 or `m'.  All constants are of a specific data type; you can
explicitly specify the type of a constant, or let the compiler
use the default type based on the value of the constant.




<H4><A NAME="SEC7">Integer Constants</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>


<P>
An integer constant is a sequence of digits.  If the sequence of digits
is preceded by <CODE>0x</CODE> or <CODE>0X</CODE> (zero x or zero X), then it is
assumed to be hexadecimal (base 16).  Hexadecimal values may use the
digits from 0 to 9, as well as the letters <CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>f</CODE>, or
<CODE>A</CODE> to <CODE>F</CODE>.



<PRE>
/* Assigning a hexadecimal value to a variable. */

x = 0x2F;
</PRE>

<P>
If the first digit is 0 (zero), and the second digit is not <CODE>x</CODE> or
<CODE>X</CODE>, then the sequence of digits is assumed to be octal (base 8).
Octal values may only use the digits from 0 to 7; 8 and 9 are not allowed.



<PRE>
/* Assigning an octal value to a variable. */

x = 057;
</PRE>

<P>
A 0 (zero) by itself is an octal value; often, it is preceded by
an additional 0 to make it obvious that it is octal.


<P>
In all other cases, the sequence of digits is assumed to be
decimal (base 10).  Decimal values may use the digits from
0 to 9.



<PRE>
/* Assigning a decimal value to a variable. */

x = 47;
</PRE>

<P>
There are various integer data types, such as <CODE>int</CODE>,
<CODE>unsigned int</CODE>, and <CODE>long int</CODE>.  You can append a sequence
of one or more letters to the end of an integer constant to cause
it to be of a certain integer data type.  The letters that you can
use (and their meanings) are:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>U</CODE>
<DD>
Unsigned integer type.

<DT><CODE>l</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>L</CODE>
<DD>
Long integer type.

</DL>

<P>
For example, <CODE>45U</CODE> is an <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> constant.  You can
also combine letters: <CODE>45UL</CODE> is an <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE> constant.
(The letters may be used in any order.)  You can use two <CODE>L</CODE>'s to
get a <CODE>long long int</CODE> constant; add a <CODE>U</CODE> and you have an
<CODE>unsigned long long int</CODE> constant.


<P>
There is no way to force an integer constant to be interpreted
a short integer.  In addition, an integer constant will never be
interpreted as a short integer by default, even if its value is
small enough to be represented as one.




<H4><A NAME="SEC8">Character Constants</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>


<P>
A character constant is a sequence of one or more characters enclosed
within single quotation marks, such as <CODE>'Q'</CODE>.  A character constant
is of type <CODE>int</CODE>.


<P>
In most cases, the value of a character constant is the character which
is enclosed within the single quotation marks; however, some characters,
such as the single quotation mark character <CODE>'</CODE> itself, cannot be
represented using only one character.  To represent such characters,
there are several "escape sequences" that you can use:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>\\</CODE>
<DD>
Backslash character.

<DT><CODE>\?</CODE>
<DD>
Question mark character.

<DT><CODE>\'</CODE>
<DD>
Single quotation mark.

<DT><CODE>\"</CODE>
<DD>
Double quotation mark.

<DT><CODE>\a</CODE>
<DD>
Audible alert.

<DT><CODE>\b</CODE>
<DD>
Backspace character.

<DT><CODE>\e</CODE>
<DD>
&#60;ESC&#62; character.

<DT><CODE>\f</CODE>
<DD>
Form feed.

<DT><CODE>\n</CODE>
<DD>
Newline character.

<DT><CODE>\r</CODE>
<DD>
Carriage return.

<DT><CODE>\t</CODE>
<DD>
Horizontal tab.

<DT><CODE>\v</CODE>
<DD>
Vertical tab.

<DT><CODE>\ooo</CODE>
<DD>
Octal number.

<DT><CODE>\xhh</CODE>
<DD>
Hexadecimal number.

</DL>

<P>
To use any of these escape sequences, enclose the sequence in single
quotes, and treat it is if it were any other character.  For example,
the letter m is <CODE>'m'</CODE> and the newline character is <CODE>'\n'</CODE>.


<P>
The octal number escape sequence is the backslash character followed by
one, two, or three octal digits (0 to 7). For example, 101 is the
octal equivalent of 65, which is the ASCII character <CODE>'A'</CODE>. Thus,
the character constant <CODE>'\101'</CODE> is the same as the character
constant <CODE>'A'</CODE>.


<P>
The hexadecimal escape sequence is the backslash character, followed
by <CODE>x</CODE> and an unlimited number of hexadecimal digits (0 to 9, and
<CODE>a</CODE> to <CODE>f</CODE> or <CODE>A</CODE> to <CODE>F</CODE>).


<P>
Since we are dealing with character constants, and the number of
hexadecimal digits is unlimited, but the range of characters is not,
please use some common sense.  There is no need to refer to the
394,203,192,245th character if there are only 256 characters to
choose from.  If you try to use a hexadecimal value that is outside
the range of characters, you will get a compile-time error.


<P>
You can make a character constant a "wide" character by appending
the letter L to it, outside of the quotation marks.  For example,
<CODE>L'm'</CODE>, and is of the data type <CODE>wchar_t</CODE> (defined in the
&#60;stddef.h&#62; header file).




<H4><A NAME="SEC9">Floating Point Constants</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>


<P>
A floating point constant is a value that represents a fractional
number.  It consists of a sequence of digits which represents the
integer (or "whole") part of the number, a decimal point, and
a sequence of digits which represents the fractional part.


<P>
The integer part and the fractional part are not both required.  If
you leave out the integer part, then the decimal point is necessary.
If you leave out the decimal part, then the decimal point is optional.
You can't leave out both the integer <EM>and</EM> the decimal parts;
that would cause a compile time error, and it would be a rather strange
thing to do anyway.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
/* Assigning floating point constants to variables. */

a = 4.7;     /* This is okay. */

b = 4.;      /* This is okay. */

c = 4;       /* This is okay. */

d = .7;      /* This is okay. */

e = 0.7;     /* This is okay. */

f = .;       /* This is NOT okay! */
</PRE>

<P>
Floating point constants can also be followed by <CODE>e</CODE> or
<CODE>E</CODE>, and an integer exponent.  The exponent can be positive
or negative, but you can't leave it out (unless you want a compile-time
error).



<PRE>
/* Assigning a floating point constant with exponent. */

x = 5e2;   /* <CODE>x</CODE> is 500.0. */
y = 5e-2;  /* <CODE>y</CODE> is 0.05. */
</PRE>

<P>
You can append a letter to the end of a floating point constant
to cause it to be of a certain data type.  If you append the letter
F (or f) to a floating point constant, then its type is <CODE>float</CODE>.
If you append the letter L (or l), then its type is <CODE>long double</CODE>.
If you do not append any letters, then its type is <CODE>double</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC10">String Literals</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>


<P>
A string literal, or string constant, is a sequence of
characters, digits, and/or escape sequences enclosed within
double quotation marks.  A string literal is of type "array
of characters".


<P>
Adjacent string literals are concatenated (combined) into
one string.  After this, the null character <CODE>\0</CODE> is
added to the end of the string.  The null character is used
to indicate where the string ends.  All string literals
contain the null character as their last character, even if it
is not explicitly stated.


<P>
A string cannot contain double quotation marks, as double
quotation marks are used to enclose the string.  To include
the double quotation mark character in a string, use the <CODE>\"</CODE>
escape sequence.  You can use any of the escape sequences that can
be used as character constants in strings.  Here are some example
of string literals:


<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>



<PRE>
/* This is a single string literal. */
"tutti frutti ice cream"

/* These three string literals will be concatenated. */
"pistachio " "ice " "cream"

/* This one uses two escape sequences. */
"\"Hello, world!\""
</PRE>

<P>
You can use wide characters in a string by using the <CODE>L</CODE>
prefix, such as <CODE>L"chocolate"</CODE>.  If a string uses wide
characters, then its data type is "array of wchar_t".  You can
concatenate wide strings with normal strings, and the resulting
string is a wide string.




<H3><A NAME="SEC11">Operators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>


<P>
An operator is a token that performs an operation, such as
addition or subtraction, on either one, two, or three operands.
Many operators are one character long, but some are more than
that.  Full coverage of operators can be found in a separate
chapter, but here are some examples: <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`&#62;='</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`||'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC60">Expressions and Operators</A>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC12">Separators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>


<P>
A separator is a token that is used to separate parts of
an expression.  White space is a separator, but it is not a token.
The other separators are:



<PRE>
( ) [ ] { } ; , . :
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC13">Comments</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>


<P>
A comment is a section of a program's source code used to describe
the program.  During the early stages of a program's compilation, all
comments are replaced with a single spaces.  A comment
begins with the characters <CODE>/*</CODE> and ends with the characters
<CODE>*/</CODE>.



<PRE>
/* This is a comment. */

x = 47;    /* <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is now 47. */

/* This is also a comment. */
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use C++-style comments.  You put the characters <CODE>//</CODE> where
you want the comment to begin, and the rest of that line is a comment.
Anything on the line prior to the comment characters remains uncommented.



<PRE>
x = 47;    // <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is now 47.
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
Regular (non C++-style) comments cannot be nested; that is, one comment
cannot exist within another comment.  For example, this won't work:



<PRE>
/* This is a /* comment. */ */
</PRE>

<P>
The above example will not compile because the <CODE>*/</CODE> that ends
the inner comment also ends the outer comment, which leaves an
unmatched <CODE>*/</CODE> at the end of the line.  You can put C++-style
comments inside regular comments, though:



<PRE>
/* This is a // comment. */
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC14">White Space</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>


<P>
<EM>White space</EM> is the collective term used for a number of
characters, including the space character, the tab character,
and the newline character.  In C programs, white space is
ignored, and is therefore optional, except when it is used to
separate tokens.  This means that



<PRE>
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;

int
main()
{
  printf( "hi there\n" );
  return 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
and



<PRE>
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62; int main(){printf("hi there\n");
return 0;}
</PRE>

<P>


<P>
are functionally the same program.  Certainly, the second
of those examples looks a bit confusing, but they both do the
same thing.


<P>
Although you must use white space to separate most tokens, no
white space is required between operators and operands, nor is
it required between separators and that which they separate.



<PRE>
/* All of these are valid. */

x++;
x ++ ;
x=y+z;
x = y + z ;
x=array[2];
x = array [ 2 ] ;
fraction=numerator/*denominator_ptr;
fraction = numerator / * denominator_ptr ;
</PRE>

<P>
Furthermore, wherever one space is allowed, any white space
is allowed.



<PRE>
/* These two statements are functionally identical. */
x++;

x
       ++       ;
</PRE>

<P>
In string literals, spaces and tabs are not ignored; rather, they are
part of the string.  Therefore,


<P>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>



<PRE>
"potato knish"
</PRE>

<P>
is not the same as



<PRE>
"potato                        knish"
</PRE>

<P>
If a string is too long to fit on one line, you can use a slash <CODE>/</CODE>
to break it up onto separate lines.



<PRE>
/* This is <EM>not</EM> a valid string. */
"Today's special is a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with
a potato knish and a cherry soda."

/* This <EM>is</EM> valid. */
"Today's special is a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with /
a potato knish and a cherry soda."
</PRE>

<P>
The slash <CODE>/</CODE> works, but you have another option.  Adjacent
strings are automatically concatenated, so you can have strings span multiple
lines by writing them as several separate, yet adjacent, strings.  For
example:



<PRE>
"Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on "
"pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."
</PRE>

<P>
is the same as



<PRE>
"Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on /
pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."
</PRE>

<P>
To force a newline character into the string, so that when the string
is printed it will be printed on two different lines, you can use the newline
escape sequence <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>.



<PRE>
printf ("potato\nknish");
</PRE>

<P>
prints



<PRE>
potato
knish
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC15">Primitive Data Types</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>


<P>
GNU C provides several categories of primitive data types: integers,
floating point numbers, and complex numbers.  You can create custom data
types, such as structures and arrays, using the primitive data types.




<H2><A NAME="SEC16">Integer Data Types</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>


<P>
The integer data types range in size from 8 bits to 64 bits.  You should
use them for storing whole number values (and the <CODE>char</CODE> data type
for storing characters).



<UL>

<A NAME="IDX32"></A>

<UL>
<LI>Depending on your system, the <CODE>char</CODE> data type is defined as

equivalent to either the <CODE>signed char</CODE> or the <CODE>unsigned char</CODE>

</UL>

<LI><CODE>unsigned int</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX34"></A>

<UL>
<LI>The 32-bit <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> data type can hold integer values in

also refer to this data type as <CODE>unsigned long long</CODE>.
</UL>

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17">Floating Point Data Types</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>


<P>
To work with fractional numbers, GNU C provides several floating point
data types that can hold numbers such as 3.14159, 2.83, and 5.00.  The
exact sizes and value ranges for the floating point data types can
vary from system to system; these values are stored in macros in the header
file <CODE>float.h</CODE>, which you can access on your system.  Here we provide
the names of the macros that contain these values:



<UL>

<LI><CODE>float</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX43"></A>

<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>float</CODE> data type is the smallest of the three floating point

types, if they differ in size at all.  Its minimum value is stored in
the <CODE>FLT_MIN</CODE>, and is supposed to be no greater than 1e(-37).
Its maximum value is stored in <CODE>FLT_MAX</CODE>, and is supposed to be no
less than 1e37.
</UL>

<LI><CODE>double</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX44"></A>

<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>double</CODE> data type is at least as large as the <CODE>float</CODE>

type, and it may be larger.  Its minimum value is stored in
<CODE>DBL_MIN</CODE>, and its maximum value is stored in <CODE>DBL_MAX</CODE>.
</UL>

<LI><CODE>long double</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX45"></A>

<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>long double</CODE> data type is at least as large as the

<CODE>float</CODE> type, and it may be larger.  Its minimum value is stored in
<CODE>LDBL_MIN</CODE>, and its maximum value is stored in <CODE>LDBL_MAX</CODE>.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
All floating point data types are signed; if you attempt to use
<CODE>unsigned float</CODE>, for example, it will cause a compile-time error.




<H2><A NAME="SEC18">Complex Number Data Types</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>


<P>
GNU C provides support for complex data types.  You can declare complex
character types, complex integer types, and complex floating point
types using the keyword <CODE>__complex__</CODE>.  We won't give you a
complete list of all possibilities, since
<CODE>__complex__</CODE> can be used with any of the character, integer, or
floating point data types, but here are some examples:



<UL>

<LI><CODE>__complex__ float</CODE>


<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>__complex__ float</CODE> data type has two components--a real

part and an imaginary part, both of which are of the <CODE>float</CODE> data type.
</UL>

<LI><CODE>__complex__ int</CODE>


<UL>
<LI>The <CODE>__complex__ int</CODE> data type also has two components--a

real part and an imaginary part, both of which are of the <CODE>int</CODE> data
type.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression, use the keyword
<CODE>__real__</CODE>, followed by the expression.  Likewise, use <CODE>__imag__</CODE>
to extract the imaginary part.



<PRE>
__complex__ float a = 4 + 3i;

float b = __real__ a;          /* <CODE>b</CODE> is now 4. */
float c = __imag__ a;          /* <CODE>c</CODE> is now 3. */
</PRE>

<P>
That trivial example creates a complex floating point variable <CODE>a</CODE>,
and defines its real part as 4 and its imaginary part as 3.  Then, the
real part is assigned to the floating point variable <CODE>b</CODE>, and the
imaginary part is assigned to the floating point variable <CODE>c</CODE>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC19">The <CODE>void</CODE> Type</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>


<P>
You cannot declare variables of type <CODE>void</CODE>, but you can declare pointers of type
<CODE>void</CODE> and use <CODE>void</CODE> as a function return type and as a function parameter
list.



<PRE>
/* Creating a <CODE>void</CODE> pointer. */

void *p;
</PRE>


<PRE>
/* Using <CODE>void</CODE> in a function declaration. */

void go_fishing (void);
</PRE>

<P>
These are both trivial examples; more detailed explanation of the
<CODE>void</CODE> type is in the chapters about pointers (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC30">Pointers</A>) and
about functions (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC119">Functions</A>).




<H2><A NAME="SEC20">Declaring Primitive Variables</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>


<P>
You can declare a variable of a primitive type by specifying the type,
followed by a name for the variable and a semicolon.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int i;
float f;
</PRE>

<P>
That example declares the variables <CODE>i</CODE> and <CODE>f</CODE>, which are of the
types <CODE>int</CODE> and <CODE>float</CODE>, respectively.


<P>
You can declare multiple variables of the same type in the same statement
by separating their names with commas, like this:



<PRE>
int a, b, c;
</PRE>

<P>
When you simply declare a variable, no value is assigned to it--all that
happens is the needed memory space is reserved, and the variable is given
its name and type.




<H2><A NAME="SEC21">Initializing Primitive Variables</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>


<P>
You can initialize a variable to a certain value when you declare by
including the assignment operator and a value for the variable in the
declaration.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int i = 5;
</PRE>

<P>
The value that you use to initialize a variable must be a valid value
for the variable's data type.


<P>
You can also initialize multiple variables in the same statement.  You
can even initialize some of the variables in a single statement, but not
all of them, like this:



<PRE>
int a = 3, b, c = 4;
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, the variables <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>c</CODE> are both declared and
initialized, but <CODE>b</CODE> is only declared, and not initialized.




<H1><A NAME="SEC22">Arrays</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>


<P>
An <EM>array</EM> is a custom data structure that consists of zero or more
elements stored consecutively in memory. 




<H2><A NAME="SEC23">Defining Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>


<P>
You define an array by specifying the data type for its elements, its name,
and the number of elements it can hold.  You put the number of elements
inside a set of square brackets.  Here is an example that defines an array
of integers named <SAMP>`my_array'</SAMP>, which holds 10 elements:



<PRE>
int my_array[10];
</PRE>

<P>
The number of elements can be as small as zero, but it cannot be negative.
Zero-length arrays are useful as the last element of a structure which is
really a header for a variable-length object:



<PRE>
struct line
{
  int length;
  char contents[0];
};

{
  struct line *this_line = (struct line *)
    malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
  this_line -&#62; length = this_length;
}
</PRE>

<P>
You do not have to specify the number of elements using a constant value.
For example, here is a function definition that defines an array using its
parameter as the number of elements:



<PRE>
int
my_function (int number)
{
  int my_array[number];
  ...;
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC24">Initializing Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>


<P>
You can initialize the elements in an array when you define it by listing
the initializing values, separated by commas, in a set of braces.  Here
is an example:



<PRE>
int my_array[5] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
</PRE>

<P>
You don't have to initialize all of the array elements.  For example, this code
initializes only the first three elements:



<PRE>
int my_array[5] = { 0, 1, 2 };
</PRE>

<P>
That leaves the last two elements uninitialized.


<P>
You can also initialize array elements out of order, by specifying which
array indices to initialize.  To do this, include the array index in brackets,
and optionally the assignment operator, before the value.  (The first
element in an array is at position 0, not 1.)  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int my_array[5] = { [2] 5, [4] 9 };
</PRE>

<P>
Or, using the assignment operator:



<PRE>
int my_array[5] = { [2] = 5, [4] = 9 };
</PRE>

<P>
Both of those examples are equivalent to:



<PRE>
int my_array[5] = { 0, 0, 5, 0, 9 };
</PRE>

<P>
You can also initialize a range of elements to the same
value, by specifying the first and last indices, in
the form <CODE> [<VAR>first</VAR>] ... [<VAR>last</VAR>] </CODE>.  Here
is an example:



<PRE>
int new_array[100] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 98] = 2, 3 };
</PRE>

<P>
That initializes elements 0 through 9 to 1, elements 10 through 98
to 2, and element 99 to 3.  (You also could explicitly write
<CODE>[99] = 3</CODE>.)  Also, notice that you <EM>must</EM> have spaces on both
sides of the <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>.


<P>
If you initialize every element of an array, then you do not have to
specify its size; its size is determined by the number of elements you
initialize.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int my_array[] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
</PRE>

<P>
Although this does not explicitly state that the array has five elements
using <CODE>my_array[5]</CODE>, it initializes five elements, so that is how many
it has.


<P>
Alternately, if you specify which elements to initialize, then the size of
the array is equal to the highest element number initialized, plus one.
For example:



<PRE>
int my_array[] = { 0, 1, 2, [99] = 99 };
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, only four elements are initialized, but the last one
initialized is element number 99, so there are 100 elements.  (In GNU C,
you start counting array elements with zero, not one.)




<H2><A NAME="SEC25">Accessing Array Elements</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>


<P>
You can access the elements of an array by specifying the array name,
followed by the element index, enclosed in brackets.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
my_array[0] = 5;
</PRE>

<P>
That assigns the value 5 to the first element in the array, at position
zero.  You can treat individual array elements like variables of whatever
data type the array is made up of.  For example, if you have an array made
of a structure data type, you can access the structure elements like this:



<PRE>
struct point
{
  int x, y;
};

struct point point_array[2] = { {4, 5}, {8, 9} };

point_array[0].x = 3;
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC26">Multidimensional Arrays</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>


<P>
In GNU C, you can define multidimensional arrays, or "arrays of arrays".
You do this by adding an extra set of brackets and array lengths for every
additional dimension you want your array to have.  For example, here is
a definition for a two-dimensional array that holds five elements in
both dimensions:



<PRE>
int two_dimensions[5][5];
</PRE>

<P>
You can think of a two-dimensional array as a two-dimensional coordinate
space, or a set of rows and columns, among other things.




<H2><A NAME="SEC27">Arrays as Strings</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>


<P>
You can use an array to hold a string (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC10">String Literals</A>).




<H3><A NAME="SEC28">Declaring and Initializing String Arrays</A></H3>

<P>
To use an array to hold a string, you create a character array.  You can use
either signed or unsigned characters.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
When you declare the array, you can specify the number of elements it will
have.  That number will be the maximum number of characters that should be
in the string, including the null character used to end the string.  If you
choose this option, then you do not have to initialize the array when you
declare it.  Alternately, you can choose not to explicitly state the number of
elements the array will have.  In this case, you must initialize the array,
and then its size will be exactly large enough to hold whatever string you
used to initialize it.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
There are two different ways to initialize the array.  You can specify of
comma-delimited list of characters enclosed in braces, or you can specify a
string literal enclosed in double quotation marks.


<P>
Here are some examples:



<PRE>
char blue[26];  // This array can hold 26 characters, including
                // the null character.
</PRE>


<PRE>
char yellow[26] = {'y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'w'};

char orange[26] = "orange";

char gray[] = {'g', 'r', 'a', 'y'};

char salmon[] = "salmon";
</PRE>

<P>
In all of those cases, the null character <CODE>\0</CODE> is automatically be
appended to the end of each string, even though it was not explicitly included.


<P>
Both <CODE>yellow</CODE> and <CODE>orange</CODE> can hold 26 characters; in the above
example, only seven were used.  So you could still change what characters
are in them, using up to 26 characters.  However, <CODE>gray</CODE> holds only five
characters, and <CODE>salmon</CODE> holds only seven.  Since no array size was
explicitly stated, the size is determined by the lengths of the string
literals used to initialize them.


<P>
Also, note that, after initialization, you cannot assign a new string
literal to an array using the assignment operator.  For example, this
will not work:



<PRE>
char lemon[26] = "custard";

lemon = "steak sauce";
</PRE>

<P>
However, there are functions in the GNU C library that perform operations
on string arrays.




<H3><A NAME="SEC29">A String Length Caution</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>


<P>
It is possible for you to explicitly state the number of elements in the
array, and then initialize it using a string that has more characters than
there are elements in the array.  This is not a good thing.  The larger string
will <EM>not</EM> override the previously specified size of the array, and you
will get a compile-time warning.  Since the original array size remains, any
part of the string that exceeds that original size is being put into a memory
location that was not allocated for it.


<P>
This same problem occurs regardless of if you initialize the string using
a comma-delimited sequence of characters or a string literal.




<H1><A NAME="SEC30">Pointers</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>


<P>
A pointer is a variable or constant that holds a memory address.  For
every data type in GNU C (including custom types, such as structures
and arrays), you can create a pointer that holds the memory address
of a variable of that type.




<H2><A NAME="SEC31">Declaring Pointers</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>


<P>
You declare a pointer by specifying a name for it and a data type.
The data type indicates of what type of variable the pointer will
hold memory addresses.


<P>
When you declare a pointer, you must include the indirection
operator (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC70">The Indirection Operator</A>) in between the data type
and the name.  Here is the general form of a pointer declaration:



<PRE>
<VAR>data-type</VAR> * <VAR>name</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
More commonly, programmers put the operator either directly next to
<VAR>name</VAR>, or directly next <VAR>data-type</VAR>, like this:



<PRE>
<VAR>data-type</VAR> *<VAR>name</VAR>;
<VAR>data-type</VAR>* <VAR>name</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
Any of these three is fine, and they all work the same way.  Here is an
example of declaring a pointer to hold the address of an <CODE>int</CODE> variable:



<PRE>
int *ip;
</PRE>

<P>
Be careful, though:  you must explicitly declare each pointer as a pointer,
using the indirection operator for each one:



<PRE>
int *bob, *emily;  // Two pointers.
int *rob, laura;   // A pointer and an integer variable.
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC32">Initializing Pointers</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>


<P>
You can initialize a pointer when you first declare it by specifying
a variable address to store in it.  For example, the following code
declares an <CODE>int</CODE> variable <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>, and a pointer which is
initialized with the address of <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>:



<PRE>
int i;
int *ip = &#38;i;
</PRE>

<P>
Notice the use of the address operator (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC69">The Address Operator</A>).  You
use that to get the memory address of a variable.  <EM>Be careful</EM>, though:
after you declare a pointer, you do <EM>not</EM> use the indirection
operator with the pointer's name when assigning it a new address to point
to.  On the contrary, that would change the value of the variable that
the points to.  For example:



<PRE>
int i, j;
int *ip = &#38;i;    // <SAMP>`ip'</SAMP> now holds the address of <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.

ip = &#38;j;         // <SAMP>`ip'</SAMP> now holds the address of <SAMP>`j'</SAMP>.

*ip = &#38;i;        // Now <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> holds the address of <SAMP>`i'</SAMP>.
</PRE>

<H1><A NAME="SEC34">Structures, Unions, and Enumerations</A></H1>

<P>
Structures, unions, and enumerations are all programmer-defined data
types.




<H2><A NAME="SEC35">Structures</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>


<P>
A structure is a programmer-defined data type made up of
variables of other data types (even other structure types).




<H3><A NAME="SEC36">Defining Structures</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>


<P>
You define a structure using the <CODE>struct</CODE> keyword followed by
the declarations of the structure's members, enclosed in
braces.  You declare each member of a structure just as you would
normally declare a variable--using the data type followed by one
or more variable names separated by commas, and ending with a
semicolon.  Then end the structure definition with a semicolon after
the closing brace.


<P>
You should also include a name for the structure in between the
<CODE>struct</CODE> keyword and the opening brace.  This is optional, but
if you leave it out, you can't refer to that structure data type
later on.


<P>
Here is an example of defining a simple structure for holding the
X and Y coordinates of a point:



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };
</PRE>

<P>
That defines a structure named <CODE>point</CODE>, which contains two
members, <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE>, both of which are of type <CODE>int</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC37">Declaring Structure Variables</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>


<P>
You can declare variables of a structure type when both you initially
define the structure and after the definition, provided you gave the
structure type a name.




<H4><A NAME="SEC38">Declaring Structure Variables at Definition</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>


<P>
You can declare variables of a structure type when you define the
structure type by putting the variable names after the closing
brace of the structure definition, but before the final semicolon.
You can declare more than one such variable by separating the names
with commas.



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  } first_point, second_point;
</PRE>

<P>
That example declares two variables of type <CODE>struct point</CODE>,
<CODE>first_point</CODE> and <CODE>second_point</CODE>.




<H4><A NAME="SEC39">Declaring Structure Variables After Definition</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>


<P>
You can declare variables of a structure type after defining the
structure by using the <CODE>struct</CODE> keyword and the name you
gave the structure type, followed by one or more variable names
separated by commas.



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct point first_point, second_point;
</PRE>

<P>
That example declares two variables of type <CODE>struct point</CODE>,
<CODE>first_point</CODE> and <CODE>second_point</CODE>.




<H4><A NAME="SEC40">Initializing Structure Members</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>


<P>
You can initialize the members of a structure type to have certain
values when you declare structure variables.  One way is to specify
the values in a set of braces and separated by commas.  Those values
are assigned to the structure members in the same order that the
members are declared in the structure in definition.



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct point first_point = { 5, 10 };
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, the <CODE>x</CODE> member of <CODE>first_point</CODE> gets the
value 5, and the <CODE>y</CODE> member gets the value 10.


<P>
Another way to initialize the members is to specify the name of the
member to initialize.  This way, you can initialize the members in
any order you like, and even leave some of them uninitialized.  There
are two methods that you can use--either follow the member name with
a colon, and then its value, like this:



<PRE>
struct point first_point = { y: 10, x: 5 };
</PRE>

<P>
or precede the member name with a period and assign a value
with the assignment operator, like this:



<PRE>
struct point first_point = { .y = 10, .x = 5 };
</PRE>

<P>
You can also initialize the structure variable's members when you declare
the variable during the structure definition:



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  } first_point = { 5, 10 };
</PRE>

<P>
You can also initialize less than all of a structure variable's members:



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct point first_point = { 5 };
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, only one member, <CODE>x</CODE>, is initialized.  <CODE>y</CODE> is
left uninitialized.  (This is because the members are initialized in
order of declaration, and <CODE>x</CODE> was declared before <CODE>y</CODE>.)


<P>
Here is another example that initializes a structure's members which
are structure variables themselves:



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct rectangle
  {
    struct point top_left, bottom_right;
  };

struct rectangle my_rectangle = { {0, 5}, {10, 0} };
</PRE>

<P>
That example defines the <CODE>rectangle</CODE> structure to consist of
two <CODE>point</CODE> structure variables.  Then it declares one variable
of type <CODE>struct rectangle</CODE> and initializes its members.  Since
its members are structure variables, there is an extra set of braces
surrounding the members that belong to the <CODE>point</CODE> structure
variables.  However, those extra braces are not necessary; they just
make the code easier to read.




<H3><A NAME="SEC41">Accessing Structure Members</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>


<P>
You can access the members of a structure variable using the member
access operator <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> .  You put the name of the structure
variable on the left side of the operator, and the name of the
member on the right side.



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct point first_point;

first_point.x = 0;
first_point.y = 5;
</PRE>

<P>
You can also access the members of a structure variable which is itself a
member of a structure variable.



<PRE>
struct rectangle
  {
    struct point top_left, bottom_right;
  };

struct rectangle my_rectangle;

my_rectangle.top_left.x = 0;
my_rectangle.top_left.y = 5;

my_rectangle.bottom_right.x = 10;
my_rectangle.bottom_right.y = 0;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC42">Arrays of Structures</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>


<P>
You can create an array of a structure type just like you can an array
of a primitive data type.



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };

struct point point_array [3];
</PRE>

<P>
That example creates a 3-element array of <CODE>struct point</CODE>
variables called <CODE>point_array</CODE>.  You can also initialize the
elements of a structure array:



<PRE>
struct point point_array [3] = { {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6, 7} };
</PRE>

<P>
As with initializing structures which contain structure members, the
additional inner grouping braces are optional.  But, if you use the
additional braces, then you can partially initialize some of the
structures in the array, and fully initialize others:



<PRE>
struct point point_array [3] = { {2}, {4, 5}, {6, 7} };
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, the first element of the array has only its <CODE>x</CODE>
member initialized.  Because of the grouping braces, the value 4 is
assigned to the <CODE>x</CODE> member of the second array element,
<EM>not</EM> to the <CODE>y</CODE> member of the first element, as would be
the case without the grouping braces.


<P>
After initialization, you can still access the structure members in the
array using the member access operator.  You put the array name and
element number (enclosed in brackets) to the left of the operator, and
the member name to the right.



<PRE>
struct point point_array [3];

point_array[0].x = 2;
point_array[0].y = 3;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC43">Pointers to Structures</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>


<P>
You can create a pointer to a structure type just like you can a pointer
to a primitive data type.



<PRE>
struct fish
  {
    float length, weight;
  };

struct fish salmon = {4.3, 5.8};

struct fish *fish_ptr = &#38;salmon;
</PRE>

<P>
That example creates a new structure type, <CODE>struct fish</CODE>, and
declares (and initializes) a variable of that type named <CODE>salmon</CODE>.
Finally, it declares a pointer to the type <CODE>struct fish</CODE>, and
gives it the address of <CODE>salmon</CODE>.


<P>
You can access the members of a structure variable through a pointer,
but you can't use the regular member access operator anymore.  Instead,
you have to use the indirect member access operator <SAMP>`-&#62;'</SAMP> .  Continuing
with the previous example, the following example will change the values
of the members of <CODE>salmon</CODE>:



<PRE>
fish_ptr -&#62; length = 5.1;
fish_ptr -&#62; weight = 6.2;
</PRE>

<P>
Now the <CODE>length</CODE> and <CODE>width</CODE> members in <CODE>salmon</CODE> are
5.1 and 6.2, respectively.




<H3><A NAME="SEC44">Bit Fields</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>


<P>
You can create structures with integer members of nonstandard sizes, called
<EM>bit fields</EM>.  You do this by specifying an integer (<CODE>int</CODE>,
<CODE>char</CODE>, <CODE>long int</CODE>, etc.) member as usual, and inserting a colon
and the number of bits that the member should occupy in between the
member's name and the semicolon.



<PRE>
struct card
  {
    unsigned int suit : 2;
    unsigned int face_value : 4;
  };
</PRE>

<P>
That example defines a structure type with two bit fields, <CODE>suit</CODE> and
<CODE>face_value</CODE>, which take up 2 bits and 4 bits, respectively.  <CODE>suit</CODE>
can hold values from 0 to 3, and <CODE>face_value</CODE> can hold values from 0 to
15.  Notice that these bit fields were declared as <CODE>unsigned int</CODE>; had
they been signed integers, then their ranges would have been from -2 to 1, and
from -8 to 7, respectively.


<P>
More generally, the range of an unsigned bit field of N bits is from
0 to 2^N - 1, and the range of a signed bit field of N bits is from
-(2^N) / 2 to ((2^N) / 2) - 1.




<H3><A NAME="SEC45">Size of Structures</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>

The size of a structure type is equal to the sum of the size of all of its
members, possibly plus some padding.




<H2><A NAME="SEC46">Unions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>


<P>
A union is a custom data type used for storing several variables in the
same memory space.  Although you can access any of those variables at any
time, you should only read from one of them at a time--assigning a value to
one of them overwrites the values in the others.




<H3><A NAME="SEC47">Defining Unions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>


<P>
You define a union using the <CODE>union</CODE> keyword followed by
the declarations of the union's members, enclosed in
braces.  You declare each member of a union just as you would
normally declare a variable--using the data type followed by one
or more variable names separated by commas, and ending with a
semicolon.  Then end the union definition with a semicolon after
the closing brace.


<P>
You should also include a name for the union in between the
<CODE>union</CODE> keyword and the opening brace.  This is optional, but
if you leave it out, you can't refer to that union data type
later on.


<P>
Here is an example of defining a simple union for holding an integer
value and a floating point value:



<PRE>
union numbers
  {
    int i;
    float f;
  };
</PRE>

<P>
That defines a union named <CODE>numbers</CODE>, which contains two
members, <CODE>i</CODE> and <CODE>f</CODE>, which are of type <CODE>int</CODE> and

union numbers first_number = { 5 };
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, the <CODE>i</CODE> member of <CODE>first_number</CODE> gets the
value 5.  The <CODE>f</CODE> member is left alone.


<P>
Another way to initialize a union member is to specify the name of the
member to initialize.  This way, you can initialize whichever member
you want to, not just the first one.  There are two methods that you can
use--either follow the member name with a colon, and then its value,
like this:



<PRE>
union numbers first_number = { f: 3.14159 };
</PRE>

<P>
or precede the member name with a period and assign a value
with the assignment operator, like this:



<PRE>
union numbers first_number = { .f = 3.14159 };
</PRE>

<P>
You can also initialize a union member when you declare the union
variable during the definition:



<PRE>
union numbers
  {
    int i;

  } first_number = { 5 };
</PRE>

<PRE>
union numbers
  {
    int i;
    float f;
  };

union numbers first_number;

first_number.i = 5;

first_number.f = 3.9;

union numbers number_array [3];
</PRE>

<P>
That example creates a 3-element array of <CODE>union numbers</CODE>
variables called <CODE>number_array</CODE>.  You can also initialize the
first members of the elements of a number array:



<PRE>
struct point point_array [3] = { {3}, {4}, {5} };
</PRE>

<P>
The additional inner grouping braces are optional.


<P>
After initialization, you can still access the union members in the

union numbers first_number = {4};

union numbers *number_ptr = &#38;first_number;
</PRE>

<P>
That example creates a new union type, <CODE>union numbers</CODE>, and
declares (and initializes the first member of) a variable of that type
named <CODE>first_number</CODE>.  Finally, it declares a pointer to the type
<CODE>union numbers</CODE>, and gives it the address of <CODE>first_number</CODE>.


<P>
You can access the members of a union variable through a pointer,
but you can't use the regular member access operator anymore.  Instead,
you have to use the indirect member access operator <CODE>-&#62;</CODE> .  Continuing
with the previous example, the following example will change the value
of the first member of <CODE>first_number</CODE>:



<PRE>
number_ptr -&#62; i = 450;
</PRE>

<P>
Now the <CODE>i</CODE> member in <CODE>first_number</CODE> is 450.




<H3><A NAME="SEC55">Size of Unions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>

This size of a union is equal to the size of its largest member.  Consider
the first union example from this section:



<PRE>
union numbers
  {

</PRE>

<P>
The size of the union data type is the same as <CODE>sizeof (float)</CODE>,
because the <CODE>float</CODE> type is larger than the <CODE>int</CODE> type.  Since all
of the members of a union occupy the same memory space, the union data type
size doesn't need to be large enough to hold the sum of all their sizes; it
just needs to be large enough to hold the largest member.

That example defines an enumeration, <CODE>fruit</CODE>, which contains four

<CODE>kiwi</CODE>, whose values are, by default, 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
You can also specify one or more of the values explicitly:



<PRE>
enum more_fruit {banana = -17, apple, blueberry, mango};
</PRE>

<P>
That example defines <CODE>banana</CODE> to be -17, and the remaining values are
incremented by 1---<CODE>apple</CODE> is -16, <CODE>blueberry</CODE> is -15, and
<CODE>mango</CODE> is -14.  Unless specified otherwise, an enumeration value is
equal to one more than the previous value (and the first value defaults to 0).


<P>
You can also refer to an enumeration value defined earlier in the same
enumeration:



<PRE>
enum yet_more_fruit {kumquat, raspberry, peach,
                     plum = peach + 2};
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, <CODE>kumquat</CODE> is 0, <CODE>raspberry</CODE> is 1,
<CODE>peach</CODE> is 2, and <CODE>plum</CODE> is 4.




<H3><A NAME="SEC58">Declaring Enumerations</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>


<P>
You can declare variables of an enumeration type both when the enumeration
is defined and afterward.



<PRE>
enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango} my_fruit;
</PRE>

<P>
That example declares one variable of type <CODE>enum fruit</CODE>.



<PRE>
enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango};

enum fruit my_fruit;
</PRE>

<P>
That example also declares one variable of type <CODE>enum fruit</CODE>.  (Of
course, you couldn't declare it that way if you hadn't named the
enumeration.)


<P>
Although such variables are considered to be of an enumeration type, you
can assign them any value that you could assign to an <CODE>int</CODE> variable,
including values from other enumerations.  Furthermore, any variable that
can be assigned an <CODE>int</CODE> value can be assigned a value from an
enumeration.


<P>
However, you cannot change the values in an enumeration once it has been
defined; they are constant values.  For example, this won't work:



<PRE>
enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango};

banana = 15;  /* You can't do this! */
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC59">Incomplete Types</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>


<P>
You can define structures, unions, and enumerations without listing their
members (or values, in the case of enumerations).  Doing so results in
an incomplete type.  You can't declare variables of incomplete types, but
you can work with pointers to those types.



<PRE>
struct point;
</PRE>

<P>
At some time later in your program you will most likely want to complete
the type.  You do this by defining it as you usually would:



<PRE>
struct point
  {
    int x, y;
  };
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC60">Expressions and Operators</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC61">Expressions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>


<P>
An <EM>expression</EM> consists of at least one operand and zero or more
operators.  The operands may be any value, including constants, variables,
and function calls that return values.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
47
2 + 2
function()
</PRE>

<P>
The last of those expressions, <CODE>function()</CODE>, is only an expression
if <CODE>function()</CODE> has a return type other than <CODE>void</CODE>.


<P>
You can use parentheses to group subexpressions.



<PRE>
( 2 * ( ( 3 + 10 ) - ( 2 * 6 ) ) )
</PRE>

<P>
When you use parentheses, the innermost expressions are evaluated
first.  So, in the above example, <CODE>3 + 10</CODE> and <CODE>2 * 6</CODE> evaluate to
<CODE>13</CODE> and <CODE>12</CODE>, respectively.  Then <CODE>12</CODE> is subtracted
from <CODE>13</CODE>, resulting in <CODE>1</CODE>.  Finally, <CODE>1</CODE> is multiplied by
<CODE>2</CODE>, resulting in <CODE>2</CODE>.  The outermost parentheses are completely
optional.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>


<P>
An <EM>operator</EM> specifies an operation to be performed on its operand(s).
In GNU C, operators may have one, two, or three operands, depending on the
operator.  These are known as unary operators, binary operators, and
ternary operators, respectively.




<H2><A NAME="SEC62">Unary Operators</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>




<H3><A NAME="SEC63">The Increment Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>


<P>
The increment operator <SAMP>`++'</SAMP> adds 1 to its operand.  The operand must
be a either a variable of one of the primitive data types, a pointer, or an
enumeration variable.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
int x = 5;
char y = 'B';
float z = 5.2;
int *p = &#38;x;

x++;   /* <CODE>x</CODE> is now 6. */
y++;   /* <CODE>y</CODE> is now `C'. */
z++;   /* <CODE>z</CODE> is now 6.2. */
p++;   /* <CODE>p</CODE> is now <CODE>&#38;x</CODE> + <CODE>sizeof(int)</CODE>. */
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the increment operator either before or after the operand---
prefix or postfix, respectively.  A prefix increment adds 1 before the
operand is evaluated.  A postfix increment adds 1 after the operand is
evaluated.  In the previous examples, that wouldn't have made any
difference.  However, there are cases where it does make a difference:



<PRE>
int x = 5;

printf ("%d \n", x++);    /* Print <CODE>x</CODE> and then increment it. */

/* <CODE>x</CODE> is now equal to 6. */

printf ("%d \n", ++x);    /* Increment <CODE>x</CODE> and then print it. */
</PRE>

<P>
The output of the above example is:



<PRE>
5
7
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC64">The Decrement Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>


<P>
The decrement operator <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> subtracts 1 from its operand.  The operand
must be a either a variable of one of the primitive data types, a pointer, or
an enumeration variable.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
int x = 5;
char y = 'B';
float z = 5.2;
int *p = &#38;x;

x--;   /* <CODE>x</CODE> is now 4. */
y--;   /* <CODE>y</CODE> is now `A'. */
z--;   /* <CODE>z</CODE> is now 4.2. */
p--;   /* <CODE>p</CODE> is now <CODE>&#38;x</CODE> - <CODE>sizeof(int)</CODE>. */
</PRE>

<P>
You can use the decrement operator either before or after the operand---
prefix or postfix, respectively.  A prefix decrement subtracts 1 before the
operand is evaluated.  A postfix increment subtracts 1 after the operand is
evaluated.  In the previous examples, that wouldn't have made any
difference.  However, there are cases where it does make a difference:



<PRE>
int x = 5;

printf ("%d \n", x--);   /* Print <CODE>x</CODE> and then decrement it. */

/* x is now 4 */

printf ("%d \n", --x);   /* Decrement <CODE>x</CODE> and then print it. */
</PRE>

<P>
The output of the above example is:



<PRE>
5
3
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC65">The Positive Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>


<P>
You can use the positive operator <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> on numeric variables and constants
to indicate that their value is positive.  By default, values are positive
unless explicitly stated to be negative, so there is no need to use the
positive operator.  However, you can use it to visually enforce the fact
that a value is positive.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
int x = +5;
float y = +3.14159;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC66">The Negative Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>


<P>
You can use the negative operator <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> on numeric variables and constants
to indicate that their value is negative.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
int x = -5;
float y = -3.14159;
</PRE>

<P>
If the operand you use with the negative operator is of an unsigned data
type, then the result is not negative, but rather it is the
maximum value of the unsigned data type, minus the value of the operand.




<H3><A NAME="SEC67">The Logical Negation Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX134"></A>


<P>
You can use the logical negation operator <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> to get the logical
opposite of its operand.  If its operand is 0 (or null if the operand is
a pointer), then the result of the logical negation operator is 1.  If its
operand is anything other than 0 (or null), then the result of the logical
negation operator is 0.  Either way, the result is an integer value.  Here
are some examples:



<PRE>
int x = !5;   /* <CODE>x</CODE> is 0. */

if (!x)
  printf ("x is 0");
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC68">The Bitwise Complement Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>


<P>
You can use the bitwise complement operator <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> to find the one's
complement of its operand.  The operand must be an integer or character type.
The bitwise complement operator examines its operand's bits, and
changes all 0 bits to 1 and all 1 bits to 0.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
unsigned int x = 500;
unsigned int y;

y = ~x;
</PRE>

<P>
Using signed data types with the bitwise complement operator may cause
portability problems.  You should use unsigned data types for maximum
portability.




<H3><A NAME="SEC69">The Address Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>


<P>
You can use the address operator <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> to obtain the memory address
of its operand.  You can use this operator both with variables of any data type
(including arrays and structures) and with functions, but you can't
use it with literal values.  You should only store the result of the
address operator in pointer variables.



<PRE>
int x = 5;
int *ptr;

ptr = &#38;x;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC70">The Indirection Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>


<P>
You can use the indirection operator <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> to obtain the value stored
at the address stored in its operand.  This is also known as
<EM>dereferencing</EM> its operand.  Its operand must be a pointer.



<PRE>
int x = 5;
int y;
int *ptr;

ptr = &#38;x;    /* <CODE>ptr</CODE> now holds the address of <CODE>x</CODE>. */

y = *ptr;    /* <CODE>y</CODE> gets the value stored at the address
                stored in <CODE>ptr</CODE>. */
</PRE>

<P>
Be sure to only use the indirection operator with pointers that have
been initialized.  Otherwise, the value stored in those pointers probably
won't be anything you want to use.




<H3><A NAME="SEC71">The Complex Conjugation Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>


<P>
You can use the complex conjugation operator <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> to perform complex
conjugation on its operand -- that is, it reverses the sign of its
imaginary component.   The operand must be an expression of a complex number
type.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
__complex__ int x = 5 + 17i;

printf ("%d  \n", (x * ~x));
</PRE>

<P>
Since an imaginary number <EM>(a + bi)</EM> multiplied by its conjugate is equal
to <EM>a^2 + b^2</EM>, the above <CODE>printf</CODE> statement will print 314, which
is equal to <EM>25 + 289</EM>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC72">The <SAMP>`sizeof'</SAMP> Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>


<P>
You can use the <SAMP>`sizeof'</SAMP> operator to obtain the size (in bytes)
of the data type of its operand.  The operand may be an actual type
specifier (such as <CODE>int</CODE> or <CODE>float</CODE>), as well as any valid
expression.  You must enclose the operand in parentheses after the
operator.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
printf ("%d \n", sizeof (int) );
printf ("%d \n", sizeof (float) );
printf ("%d \n", sizeof (5) );
printf ("%d \n", sizeof (5.1) );
</PRE>

<P>
The result of the <SAMP>`sizeof'</SAMP> operator is of a type called <CODE>size_t</CODE>,
which is defined in the header file <CODE>stddef.h</CODE>.  <CODE>size_t</CODE> is
an unsigned integer type, perhaps identical to <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> or
<CODE>unsigned long int</CODE>.  This can vary from system to system.




<H3><A NAME="SEC73">Type Casts</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>


<P>
You can use a type cast to explicitly declare the data type of an expression.
A type cast consists of a type specifier enclosed in parentheses, followed
by an expression.  To ensure proper casting, you should also enclose
the expression that follows the type specifier in parentheses.  Here is
an example:



<PRE>
float x;
int y = 7;
int z = 3;

x = (float)(y / z);
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, since <CODE>y</CODE> and <CODE>z</CODE> are both integers, integer
division is performed, and even though <CODE>x</CODE> is a floating-point
variable, it receives the value 2.  By explicitly casting the result
of the division to <CODE>float</CODE>, the floating-point value 2.333...
can be retained and assigned to <CODE>x</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC74">Array Subscripts</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>


<P>
You can access array elements by specifying the name of the array, and the
array subscript (or index, or element number) enclosed in brackets.  Here is
an example, using an integer array called <CODE>my_array</CODE>:



<PRE>
my_array[0] = 5;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC75">Function Calls as Expressions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>


<P>
A function call is an expression if the function returns a
value, regardless of if the returned value is used or not.



<PRE>
int function( void );

a = 10 + function();
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX146"></A>




<H3><A NAME="SEC77">The Addition Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>


<P>
You use the addition operator <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> to add two operands.  You put the
operands on either side of the operator, and it does not matter which operand
is goes on which side:  <CODE>3 + 5</CODE> and <CODE>5 + 3</CODE> both result in 8.
The operands must be either expressions of a primitive data type or pointers.



<PRE>
x = 5 + 3;
y = 10 + 37;
z = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use more than one addition operator (and more than two operands),
such as in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to right.




<H3><A NAME="SEC78">The Subtraction Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>


<P>
You use the subtraction operator <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> to subtract its second operand
from its first operand.  You put the operands on either side of the operator,
and it does matter which operand goes on which side:  <CODE>3 - 5</CODE> and
<CODE>5 - 3</CODE> do not both have the same result.  The operands must be either
expressions of a primitive data type or pointers.



<PRE>
x = 5 - 3;
y = 57 - 10;
z = 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use more than one subtraction operator (and more than two operands),
such as in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to
right.




<H3><A NAME="SEC79">The Multiplication Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>


<P>
You use the multiplication operator <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> to multiply two operands
together.  You put the operands on either side of the operator, and it does
not matter which operand goes on which side:  <CODE>3 * 5</CODE> and <CODE>5 * 3</CODE>
both result in 15.  The operands must be expressions of a primitive
data type.



<PRE>
x = 5 * 3;
y = 47 * 1;
z = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use more than one multiplication operator (and more than two
operands), such as in the last example, the expression is evaluated from
left to right.




<H3><A NAME="SEC80">The Division Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>


<P>
You use the division operator <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> to divide its first operand
by its second operand.  You put the operands on either side of the
operator, and it does matter which operand goes on which side:  <CODE>3 / 5</CODE>
and <CODE>5 / 3</CODE> do not both have the same result.  The operands must be
expressions of a primitive data type.



<PRE>
x = 5 / 3;
y = 940 / 20;
z = 100 / 2 / 2;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use more than one division operator (and more than two operands),
such as in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to right.




<H3><A NAME="SEC81">The Modulus Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>


<P>
You use the modulus operator <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to obtain the remainder produced
by dividing its two operands.  You put the operands on either side of
the operator, and it does matter which operand goes on which
side:  <CODE>3 % 5</CODE> and <CODE>5 \% 3</CODE> do not both have the same result.
The operands must be expressions of a primitive data type.



<PRE>
x = 5 % 3;
y = 74 % 47;
z = 47 % 32 % 21;
</PRE>

<P>
When you use more than one modulus operator (and more than two operands),
like in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to right.


<P>
A common application of the modulus operator is to determine if one
number is divisible by another number.  If it is divisible, then the
remainder is zero.  Here is an example of that:



<PRE>
int counter;

for( counter = 0; counter &#60;= 100; counter++ )
  {
    if( counter % 5 == 0 )
      printf("%d\n", counter);
  }
</PRE>

<P>
That prints all of the integers from 0 to 100 that are divisible by 5.




<H3><A NAME="SEC82">The Shift Operators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>


<P>
You use the left-shift operator <SAMP>`&#60;&#60;'</SAMP> to shift its first operand's bits
to the left.  You specify the number of bit-places shifted with the second
operand.  If there is a 1 bit in the leftmost bit position, it will be
discarded.  New bits that are added to the rightmost bit position will all
be 0.



<PRE>

x = 47;    /* 47 is 00101111 in binary. */

x &#60;&#60; 1;    /* 00101111 &#60;&#60; 1 is 01011110. */
</PRE>

<P>
You use the right-shift operator <SAMP>`&#62;&#62;'</SAMP> to shift its first operand's bits
to the right.  You specify the number of bit-places shifted with the second
operand.  If there is a 1 bit in the rightmost bit position, it will be
discarded.  New bits that are added to the leftmost bit position
may be either 0 or 1.  If the first operand is unsigned, then the added
bits will be 0.  If it is signed, the added bits will be either 0 <EM>or</EM>
whatever value was previously in the leftmost bit position.



<PRE>
x = 47;   /* 47 is 00101111 in binary. */

x &#62;&#62; 1;   /* 00101111 &#62;&#62; 1 is 00010111. */
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC83">The Bitwise AND Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>


<P>
The bitwise AND operator <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> examines each bit in its two
operands, and when two corresponding bits are both 1, the resulting bit
is 1.  In every other case the result is 0.  Here is an example of
how this operator works, using binary numbers:



<PRE>
11001001 &#38; 10011011 = 10001001
</PRE>

<P>
If you look closely at that, you'll see that when a bit is 1
in both operands, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1.
Otherwise it is set to 0.  Here is another example, this time in C:



<PRE>
char x = 149, y = 34, z;

z = x &#38; y;
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC84">The Bitwise Inclusive OR Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>


<P>
The bitwise inclusive OR operator <SAMP>`|'</SAMP> examines each bit
in its two operands, and when two corresponding bits are both
0, the resulting bit is 0.  In every other case the resulting
bit is 1.  Here is an example of how this operator works, using
binary numbers:



<PRE>
11001001 | 10011011 = 11011011
</PRE>

Here is another example, this time in C:

<H3><A NAME="SEC85">The Bitwise Exclusive OR Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>


<P>
The bitwise exclusive OR operator <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> (also known as XOR) examines
each bit in its two operands, and when two corresponding bits are different,
the resulting bit is 1.  When they are the same, the resulting bit is 0.
Here is an example of how this operator works, using binary numbers:



<PRE>
11001001 | 10011011 = 01011001
</PRE>

Here is another example, this time in C.

<H3><A NAME="SEC86">The Comparison Operators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>


<P>
You use the comparison operators to determine how two operands relate to
each other--are they equal to each other, is one larger than the other,
is one smaller than the other, and so on.   When you use any of the
comparison operators, the result is either 1 or 0, meaning true or false,
respectively.


<P>
In the example program fragments, the variables <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> stand

Use the greater-than-or-equal-to operator <SAMP>`&#62;='</SAMP> to determine if the
first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand.  If it is, the
result is 1.  Otherwise, the result is 0.

<P>
You can use the logical operators to test the truth value of two

<P>
Note that while the comparison operators return the value 1 for a true

<H4><A NAME="SEC94">The Logical AND Operator</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>


<P>
Use the logical AND operator <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP> to test if two expressions are

<P>
You can also build an expression using more than one AND operator,

second expression is not evaluated.



<PRE>
if ((x == 5) || (y == 10))
   printf ("x is 5 or y is 10");

<P>
You can also build an expression using more than one OR operator, and

<H3><A NAME="SEC96">Assignment Operators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>


<P>
You use the assignment operators to give values to variables.  Regardless
of which assignment operator is being used, the first operand -- the
operand to which a value is being assigned, also known as the
"lvalue" -- cannot be a literal value or any other constant value.
Except as noted, the operands must be of a primitive data type, or a
pointer.




<H4><A NAME="SEC97">The Assignment Operator</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>


<P>
Use the standard assignment operator <SAMP>`='</SAMP> to assign the value of its
right operand to its left operand.  Unlike the other assignment operators,
you can use this operator with variables of a structure type, in addition
to primitive types and pointers.



<PRE>
x = 10;
y = 45 + 2;
z = (2 * (3 + function () ));
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="SEC98">The Compound Assignment Operators</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>


<P>
You use the compound assignment operators to perform an operation on
both the left and right operands, and then assign the resulting
expression to the left operand.  Here is a list of the compound
assignment operators, and a brief description of what they do:



<UL>

<LI>

<SAMP>`+='</SAMP>

This operator adds its two operands together, and then assigns the result of
the addition to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`-='</SAMP>

This operator subtracts its right operand from its left operand, and
assigns the result of the subtraction to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`*='</SAMP>

This operator multiplies its two operands together, and then assigns the
result of the multiplication to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`/='</SAMP>

This operator divides its left operand by its right operand, and assigns
the result of the division to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`%='</SAMP>

This operator performs modular division on its operands, and assigns the
result of the division to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`&#60;&#60;='</SAMP>

This operator performs a left shift operation on its left operand, shifting
by the number of bits specified by the right operand, and assigns the
result of the shift to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`&#62;&#62;='</SAMP>

This operator performs a right shift operation on its left operand,
shifting by the number of bits specified by the right operand, and assigns
the result of the shift to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`&#38;='</SAMP>

This operator performs a bitwise AND operation on its two operands, and
assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`^='</SAMP>

This operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on its two operands,
and assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

<LI>

<SAMP>`|='</SAMP>

This operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation on its two
operands, and assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

</UL>

<P>
Here is an example of using one of the compound assignment operators:



<PRE>
x += y;
</PRE>

<P>
That produces the same result as:



<PRE>
x = x + y;
</PRE>



<H4><A NAME="SEC99">Generalized Lvalues</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>


<P>
Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.


<P>
For example, you can assign a value to a compound expression, provided the
last expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:



<PRE>
(a, b) += 5
a, (b += 5)
</PRE>

<P>
Similarly, you can take the address of a compound expression.  So, these two
expressions are equivalent:



<PRE>
&#38;(a, b)
a, &#38;b
</PRE>

<P>
A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and if
both the second and third operands are valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:



<PRE>
(a ? b : c) = 5
(a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</PRE>

<P>
A type cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <CODE>a</CODE> has type <CODE>char *</CODE>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:



<PRE>
(int)a = 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</PRE>

<P>
An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:



<PRE>
(int)a += 5
(int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</PRE>

<P>
You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <CODE>&#38;(int)f</CODE> were
permitted, where <CODE>f</CODE> has type <CODE>float</CODE>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:



<PRE>
*&#38;(int)f = 1;
</PRE>

<P>
This is quite different from what <CODE>(int)f = 1</CODE> would do--that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <SAMP>`&#38;'</SAMP> on a cast.


<P>
If you really do want an <CODE>int *</CODE> pointer with the address of
<CODE>f</CODE>, you can simply write <CODE>(int *)&#38;f</CODE>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC100">The Comma Operator</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>


<P>
You use the comma operator <SAMP>`,'</SAMP> to separate two expressions.  These
expressions don't have to be related at all, but often the first expression
produces a value that is used by the second expression.



<PRE>
int x = 5, y = 10;

x++, y = x * x;
</PRE>

<P>
More commonly, the comma operator is used in <CODE>for</CODE> statements, like
this:



<PRE>
/* Using the comma operator in a <CODE>for</CODE> statement. */

for (x = 1, y = 10;  x &#60;=10 &#38;&#38; y &#62;=1;  x++, y--)
  {
    ...
  }
</PRE>

<P>
A comma is also used to separate function parameters; however, this
is <EM>not</EM> the comma operator in action.   In fact, if the comma
operator is used as we have discussed here in a function call (without
enclosing it in an additional set of parentheses), then the compiler will
interpret that as calling the function with an extra parameter.



<PRE>
function (x,  y=47, y,  z);
</PRE>

<P>
Even though what may be intended by such a function call is to
call the function with the parameters <CODE>x</CODE>, <CODE>y</CODE>, and
<CODE>z</CODE>, with <CODE>y</CODE> set to 47, what will happen is that the
function will be called with the parameters <CODE>x</CODE>, <CODE>y=47</CODE>,
<CODE>y</CODE>, and <CODE>z</CODE>.  So if you want to include expressions that
use the comma operator in a function call, surround the comma operator
expression with parentheses.



<PRE>
function (x,  (y=47, y),  z);
</PRE>

<P>
That will call <CODE>function</CODE> with the parameters <CODE>x</CODE>,
<CODE>y</CODE>, and <CODE>z</CODE>, with <CODE>y</CODE> set to 47.




<H3><A NAME="SEC101">Member Access Operators</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>


<P>
You can use the member access operator <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> to access the members
of a structure or union variable.  You put the name of the structure
variable on the left side of the operator, and the name of the
member on the right side.



<PRE>
struct point
{
  int x, y;
};

struct point first_point;

first_point.x = 0;
first_point.y = 5;
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
You can also access the members of a structure or union variable via
a pointer by using the indirect member access operator <SAMP>`-&#62;'</SAMP>.



<PRE>
struct fish
  {
    int length, weight;
  };

struct fish salmon;

struct fish *fish_pointer = &#38;salmon;

fish_pointer -&#62; length = 3;
fish_pointer -&#62; weight = 9;
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SEC102">The Ternary Operator</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>


<P>
GNU C has only one ternary operator -- the conditional operator <SAMP>`? :'</SAMP>.


<P>
You use the conditional operator to cause the entire conditional
expression to evaluate to either its second or its third operand, based
on the truth value of its first operand.


<P>
Put the first operand is before the question mark; this operand
may be any expression.  If it evaluates to true (nonzero), then
the second operand (which is also an expression), which is placed
in between the question mark and the colon, is evaluated, and
becomes the value of the conditional expression.  Otherwise, the third
operand (also an expression), which is placed after the colon, is
evaluated, and becomes the value of the conditional expression.  Here
is an example



<PRE>
a = (x == 5) ? y : z;
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, if <CODE>x</CODE> equals 5, then <CODE>a</CODE> will receive
the value <CODE>y</CODE>.  Otherwise, <CODE>a</CODE> will receive the value
<CODE>z</CODE>.  Really, this is a shorthand method for writing a simple
<CODE>if</CODE>...<CODE>else</CODE> statement.  The previous example will
accomplish the same task as the following example:



<PRE>
if( x != 0)
    a = y;
else
    a = z;
</PRE>

<P>
If the first operand of the conditional operator is true, then the third
operand is never evaluated.  Similarly, if the first operand is false,
then the second operand is never evaluated.  The first operand is always
evaluated.


<P>
You can also leave out the second operand -- this is similar to using the
first operand as both the first operand <EM>and</EM> the second operand.  For
example, the expression



<PRE>
x ? : y
</PRE>

<P>
has the same value as



<PRE>
x ? x : y
</PRE>

<P>
In simple examples like that one, there is no point to leaving out the
second operand.  However, if the first operand had a side effect, such
as incrementing a variable, then you might not want that side effect to
happen twice, so you shouldn't include it as both the first and second
operands.




<H2><A NAME="SEC103">Statements and Declarations in Expressions</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>


<P>
A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.


<P>
Recall that a compound statement (also known as a block) is a sequence of
statements surrounded by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around
the braces.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
({ int y = function (); int z;
   if (y &#62; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</PRE>

<P>
That is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <CODE>function ()</CODE>.


<P>
The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <CODE>void</CODE>, and thus
effectively no value.)


<P>
This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:



<PRE>
#define max(a,b) ((a) &#62; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
But this definition computes either <CODE>a</CODE> or <CODE>b</CODE> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <CODE>int</CODE>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:



<PRE>
#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &#62; _b ? _a : _b; })
</PRE>

<P>
Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or
the initial value of a static variable.


<P>
If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <CODE>typeof</CODE> expressions or type naming.

<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>


<P>
When an expression consists of subexpressions, such as
<CODE>a + b * f()</CODE>, the subexpressions are not all evaluated at once,
nor are they necessarily evaluated left to right as they appear in the
expression.  In the preceding example, for instance, the function call
<CODE>f()</CODE> will be evaluated first, the result of which will be multiplied
by <CODE>b</CODE>, the result of which will be added to <CODE>a</CODE>.  That is not
intuitive simply by looking at the expression, but there is a definite
order in which subexpressions are evaluated.


<P>
The following is a list of types of expressions, presented in the same
order that they are evaluated.  The expressions that are evaluated first
are said to have the highest precedence, and those that are evaluated last
the low precedence.  Some types of expressions have the same precedence.
If two or more subexpressions have the same precedence, then they
are usually evaluated left to right.  If they are <EM>not</EM> evaluated
left to right, then that is explicitly stated in the list.



<OL>

<LI>

Function calls, array subscripting, and membership access operator
expressions.

<LI>

Logical negation, bitwise complement, increment, decrement, unary positive,
unary negative, indirection operator, address operator, type casting, and
<CODE>sizeof</CODE> expressions.  When used as subexpressions, these are evaluated
right to left.

<LI>

Multiplication, division, and modular division expressions.

<LI>

Addition and subtraction expressions.

<LI>

Bitwise shifting expressions.

Greater-than, less-than, greater-than-or-equal-to, and less-than-or-equal-to

<H2><A NAME="SEC106">Expression Statements</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>


<P>
You can turn any expression into a statement by adding a semicolon to
the end of the expression.  Here are some examples:



<PRE>
5;
2 + 2;
10 &#62;= 9;
</PRE>

<P>
In each of those, all that happens is that each expression is
evaluated.  However, they are useless because they do not store
a value anywhere, nor do they actually do anything, other than
the evaluation itself.  The compiler is free to ignore such
statements.


<P>
Expression statements are only useful when they have some kind
of side effect, such as storing a value, calling a function, or
(this is esoteric) causing a fault in the program.  Here are
some more useful examples:



<PRE>
x++;
y = x + 25;
printf ("Hello, user!");
*cucumber;
</PRE>

<P>
The last of those statements, <CODE>*cucumber;</CODE>, could potentially
cause a fault in the program if the value of <CODE>cucumber</CODE> is both
not a valid pointer and has been declared as <CODE>volatile</CODE>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC107">Labels</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>


<P>
You can use labels to identify a section of source code.  A label
consists of an identifier (such as those used for variable names)
followed by a colon.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
treet:
</PRE>

<P>
You should be aware that label names do not interfere with other
identifier names:



<PRE>
int treet = 5;    /* <CODE>treet</CODE> the variable. */

treet:            /* <CODE>treet</CODE> the label. */
</PRE>

<P>
ISO C mandates that a label must be followed by at least one statement.
Although GCC will compile code that does not meet this requirement (and
issue a warning in the process), you might want to avoid writing such
code.




<H2><A NAME="SEC108">The <CODE>if</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>if</CODE> statement to conditionally execute a section
of your program, based on the truth value of a given expression.


<P>
You can use the <CODE>if</CODE> statement to conditionally execute part of your
program, based on the truth value of a given expression.  Here is the
general form of an <CODE>if</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
if (<VAR>test</VAR>)
  <VAR>then-statement</VAR>
else
  <VAR>else-statement</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
If <VAR>test</VAR> evaluates to true, then <VAR>then-statement</VAR> is executed and
<VAR>else-statement</VAR> is not.  If <VAR>test</VAR> evaluates to false, then
<VAR>else-statement</VAR> is executed and <VAR>then-statement</VAR> is not.  The
<CODE>else</CODE> clause is optional.


<P>
Here is an actual example:



<PRE>
if (x == 10)
  printf ("x is 10");
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>x == 10</CODE> evaluates to true, then the statement
<CODE>printf("x is 10");</CODE> is executed.  If <CODE>x == 10</CODE> evaluates to
false, then the statement <CODE>printf ("x is 10");</CODE> is not executed.


<P>
Here is an example using <CODE>else</CODE>:



<PRE>
if (x == 10)
  printf("x is 10");
else
  printf("x is not 10");
</PRE>

<P>
You can use a series of <CODE>if</CODE> statements to test for multiple
conditions:



<PRE>
if (x == 1)
  printf ("x is 1");
else if (x == 2)
  printf ("x is 2");
else if (x == 3)
  printf ("x is 3");
else
  printf ("x is something else");
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC109">The <CODE>switch</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>switch</CODE> statement to compare one expression with others,
and then execute a series of sub-statements based on the result of the
comparisons.  Here is the general form of a <CODE>switch</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
switch(<VAR>test</VAR>)
  {
    case <VAR>compare-1</VAR>:
      <VAR>if-equal-statement-1</VAR>
    case <VAR>compare-2</VAR>:
      <VAR>if-equal-statement-2</VAR>
    ...
    default:
      <VAR>default-statement</VAR>
  }
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>switch</CODE> statement compares <VAR>test</VAR> to each of the
cases of <VAR>compare</VAR> expressions, until it finds one that is
equal to <VAR>test</VAR>.  Then, the statements following the successful
case are executed.


<P>
Optionally, you can specify a default case.  If <VAR>test</VAR> doesn't match
any of the specific cases listed prior to the default case, then
the statements for the default case are executed.  Traditionally, the
default case goes after the specific cases, but that isn't required.



<PRE>
switch (x)
  {
    case 0:
      printf ("x is 0");
      break;
    case 1:
      printf ("x is 1");
      break;
    default:
      printf ("x is something else");
      break;
  }
</PRE>

<P>
Notice the usage of the <CODE>break</CODE> statement in each of the cases.  This
is because, once a matching case is found, not only are its statements
executed, but so are the statements for all following cases:



<PRE>
int x = 0;

switch (x)
  {
    case 0:
      printf ("x is 0");
    case 1:
      printf ("x is 1");
    default:
      printf ("x is something else");
  }
</PRE>

<P>
The output of that example is:



<PRE>
x is 0
x is 1
x is something else
</PRE>

<P>
This is not always desired.  Including a <CODE>break</CODE> statement at the
end of each case redirects program flow to after the <CODE>switch</CODE> statement.


<P>
You can also specify a range of consecutive integer values in a single
<CODE>case</CODE> label, like this:



<PRE>
case <VAR>low</VAR> ... <VAR>high</VAR>:
</PRE>

<P>
This has the same effect as the corresponding number of individual <CODE>case</CODE>
labels, one for each integer value from <VAR>low</VAR> to <VAR>high</VAR>, inclusive.


<P>
This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:



<PRE>
case 'A' ... 'Z':
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Be careful:</STRONG> Include spaces around the <CODE>...</CODE>; otherwise it
may be parsed incorrectly when you use it with integer values.  For
example, write this:



<PRE>
case 1 ... 5:
</PRE>

<P>
instead of this:



<PRE>
case 1...5:
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC110">The <CODE>while</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>

The <CODE>while</CODE> statement is a loop statement with an exit test at

<PRE>
while (<VAR>test</VAR>)
  <VAR>statement</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>while</CODE> statement first evaluates <VAR>test</VAR>.  If <VAR>test</VAR>
evaluates to true, <VAR>statement</VAR> is executed, and then <VAR>test</VAR> is
evaluated again.  <VAR>statement</VAR> continues to execute repeatedly as long as

<A NAME="IDX204"></A>


<P>
The <CODE>do</CODE> statement is a loop statement with an exit test at the end
of the loop.  Here is the general form of the <CODE>do</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
do
  <VAR>statement</VAR>
while (<VAR>test</VAR>);
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>do</CODE> statement first executes <VAR>statement</VAR> once.  After that,
it evaluates <VAR>test</VAR>.  If <VAR>test</VAR> is true, then <VAR>statement</VAR> is
executed again.  <VAR>statement</VAR> continues to execute repeatedly as long as
<VAR>test</VAR> is true after each execution of <VAR>statement</VAR>.



<PRE>
int x = 0;

do
  printf ("%d ", x++);
while (x &#60; 10);
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC112">The <CODE>for</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>


<P>
The <CODE>for</CODE> statement is a loop statement whose structure allows
easy variable initialization, expression testing, and variable
modification.  It is very convenient for making counter-controlled
loops.  Here is the general form of the <CODE>for</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
for (<VAR>initialize</VAR>; <VAR>test</VAR>; <VAR>step</VAR>)
  <VAR>statement</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>for</CODE> statement first evaluates the expression <VAR>initialize</VAR>.
Then it evaluates the expression <VAR>test</VAR>.  If <VAR>test</VAR> is false, then
the loop ends and program control resumes after <VAR>statement</VAR>.  Otherwise,
if <VAR>test</VAR> is true, then <VAR>statement</VAR> is executed.  Finally,
<VAR>step</VAR> is evaluated, and the next iteration of the loop begins with
evaluating <VAR>test</VAR> again.


<P>
Most often, <VAR>initialize</VAR> assigns values to one or more variables,
which are generally used as counters,  <VAR>test</VAR> compares those
variables to a predefined expression, and <VAR>step</VAR> modifies those
variables' values.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int x;

for (x = 1; x &#60;= 10; x++)
  printf ("%d ", x);
</PRE>

<P>
This example prints the integers from 1 to 10, inclusive.  First, it evaluates
<VAR>initialize</VAR>, which assigns <CODE>x</CODE> the value 1.  Then, as long as
<CODE>x</CODE> is less than or equal to 10, the value of <CODE>x</CODE> is printed and
incremented.


<P>
All three of the expressions in a <CODE>for</CODE> statement are optional, and any
combination of the three is valid.  Since the first expression is evaluated
only once, it is perhaps the most commonly omitted expression.  You could
also write the above example as:



<PRE>
int x = 1;

for (; x &#60;= 10; x++)
  printf ("%d ", x);
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, <CODE>x</CODE> receives its value prior to the beginning of the
<CODE>for</CODE> statement.


<P>
If you leave out the <VAR>test</VAR> expression, then the <CODE>for</CODE> statement
is an infinite loop (unless you put a <CODE>break</CODE> or <CODE>goto</CODE> statement
somewhere in <VAR>statement</VAR>).  This is like using <CODE>1</CODE> as
<VAR>test</VAR>; it is never false.



<PRE>
for (x = 1; ; x++)
  printf ("%d ", x);
</PRE>

<P>
This <CODE>for</CODE> statement starts printing numbers at 1 and then
continues indefinitely, always printing <CODE>x</CODE> incremented by 1.


<P>
If you leave out the <VAR>step</VAR> expression, then no progress is made
toward completing the loop--at least not as is normally expected with
a <CODE>for</CODE> statement.



<PRE>
for (x = 1; x &#60;= 10;)
  printf ("%d ", x);
</PRE>

<P>
This example prints 1 over and over, indefinitely.


<P>
You can use the comma operator for monitoring and modifying multiple
variables in a <CODE>for</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
for (x = 1, y = 10; x &#60;= 10, y &#62;= 1; x++, y--)
  printf ("%d %d ", x, y);
</PRE>

<P>
This example assigns values to both <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE>, checks that
<CODE>x</CODE> is less than or equal to 10 and that <CODE>y</CODE> is greater
than or equal to 1, and increments <CODE>x</CODE> and decrements <CODE>y</CODE>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC113">Blocks</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>


<P>
A <EM>block</EM> is a set of zero or more statements enclosed in
braces.  Often, a block is used as the body of an <CODE>if</CODE>
statement or a loop statement, to group together statements
that should all be treated as the body of an <CODE>if</CODE> or
loop statement.



<PRE>
for (x = 1; x &#60;= 10; x++)
  {
    printf("x is %d\n", x);
    
    if ((x % 2) == 0)
      printf ("%d is even\n", x);
    else
      printf ("%d is odd\n", x);
  }
</PRE>

<P>
You can also put blocks inside other blocks:



<PRE>
for (x = 1; x &#60;= 10; x++)
  {
    if ((x % 2) == 0)
      {
        printf ("x is %d\n", x);
        printf ("%d is even\n", x);
      }
    else
      {
        printf ("x is %d\n", x);
        printf ("%d is odd\n", x);
      }
  }
</PRE>

<P>
You can declare variables inside a block; such variables are local to
that block.



<PRE>
{
  int x = 5;
  printf ("%d", x);
}
printf ("%d", x);   /* You can't do this! <CODE>x</CODE> exists only
                       in the preceding block. */
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC114">The Null Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>


<P>
The <EM>null statement</EM> is merely a semicolon alone.



<PRE>
;
</PRE>

<P>
A null statement does not do anything.  It does not store a value anywhere.
It does not cause time to pass during the execution of your program.  It
does not find new prime numbers, nor does it invent new low-calorie
sugar substitutes.


<P>
Most often, a null statement is used as the body of
a loop statement, or as one or more of the expressions in a <CODE>for</CODE>
statement.  Here is an example of a <CODE>for</CODE> statement that uses the
null statement as the body of the loop (and also calculates the integer
square root of <CODE>n</CODE>, just for fun):



<PRE>
for (i = 1; i*i &#60; n; i++)
  ;
</PRE>

<P>
Here is another example that uses the null statement as the body
of a <CODE>for</CODE> loop and also produces output:



<PRE>
for (x = 1; x &#60;= 5; printf ("x is now %d\n", x), x++)
  ;
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC115">The <CODE>goto</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>goto</CODE> statement to unconditionally jump to a different
place in the program.  Here is the general form of a <CODE>goto</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
goto <VAR>label</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
You have to specify a label to jump to; when the <CODE>goto</CODE> statement
is executed, program control jumps to that label.  See section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC107">Labels</A>.  Here
is an example:



<PRE>
goto end_of_program;
...
end_of_program:
</PRE>

<P>
The label can be anywhere in the same function as the <CODE>goto</CODE>
statement that jumps to it, but a <CODE>goto</CODE> statement cannot jump to a
label in a different function.


<P>
You <EM>can</EM> use <CODE>goto</CODE> statements to simulate loop statements,
but we do not recommend it--it makes the program harder to read, and GCC
cannot optimize it as well.  You should use <CODE>for</CODE>,
<CODE>while</CODE>, and <CODE>do</CODE> statements instead of <CODE>goto</CODE> statements,
when possible.




<H2><A NAME="SEC116">The <CODE>break</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>break</CODE> statement to terminate a <CODE>while</CODE>, <CODE>do</CODE>,
<CODE>for</CODE>, or <CODE>switch</CODE> statement.  Here is an example:



<PRE>
int x;

for (x = 1; x &#60;= 10; x++)
  {
    if (x == 8)
      break;
    else
      printf ("%d ", x);
  }
</PRE>

<P>
That example prints numbers from 1 to 7.  When <CODE>x</CODE> is incremented
to 8, <CODE>x == 8</CODE> is true, so the <CODE>break</CODE> statement is executed, 
terminating the <CODE>for</CODE> loop prematurely.


<P>
If you put a <CODE>break</CODE> statement inside of a loop or <CODE>switch</CODE>
statement which itself is inside of a loop or <CODE>switch</CODE> statement, then
<CODE>break</CODE> only terminates the innermost loop or <CODE>switch</CODE> statement.




<H2><A NAME="SEC117">The <CODE>continue</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>continue</CODE> statement in loops to terminate an
iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration.  Here is an
example:



<PRE>
for (x = 0; x &#60; 100; x++)
{
  if (x % 2 == 0)
  {
    continue;
  }
  else
  {
    sum_of_odd_numbers + = x;
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
If you put a <CODE>continue</CODE> statement inside a loop which itself is
inside a loop, then it affects only the innermost loop.




<H2><A NAME="SEC118">The <CODE>return</CODE> Statement</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>


<P>
You can use the <CODE>return</CODE> statement to end the execution of a function
and return program control to the function that called it.  Here is the
general form of the <CODE>return</CODE> statement:



<PRE>
return <VAR>return-value</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>return-value</VAR> is an optional expression to return.  If the
function's return type is <CODE>void</CODE>, then it is invalid to return
an expression.  You can, however, use the <CODE>return</CODE> statement
without a return value.


<P>
If the function's return type is not the same as the type of
<VAR>return-value</VAR>, and automatic type conversion cannot be performed,
then returning <VAR>return-value</VAR> is invalid.


<P>
If the function's return type is not <CODE>void</CODE> and no return value
is specified, then the <CODE>return</CODE> statement is valid unless the
function is called in a context that requires a return value.  For
example:



<PRE>
x = cosine (y);
</PRE>

<P>
In that case, the function <CODE>cosine</CODE> was called in a context that
required a return value, so the value could be assigned to <CODE>x</CODE>.


<P>
Even in contexts where a return value is not required, it is a bad idea
for a non-<CODE>void</CODE> function to omit the return value.  With GCC, you
can use the command line option <CODE>-Wreturn-type</CODE> to issue a warning
if you omit the return value in such functions.


<P>
Here are some examples of using the <CODE>return</CODE> statement, in both
a <CODE>void</CODE> and non-<CODE>void</CODE> function:



<PRE>
void
print_plus_five (int x)
{
  printf ("%d ", x + 5);
  return;
}
</PRE>


<PRE>
int
square_value (int x)
{
  return x * x;
}
</PRE>



<H1><A NAME="SEC119">Functions</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>


<P>
You can write functions to separate parts of your program into distinct
procedures.  To write a function, you must at least create a function
definition.  It is a good idea also to have an explicit function
declaration; you don't have to, but if you leave it out, then the
implicit declaration might not match the function itself, and you will
get some compile-time warnings.


<P>
Every program requires at least one function, called <CODE>main</CODE>.
That is where the program's execution begins.




<H2><A NAME="SEC120">Function Declarations</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>


<P>
You write a function declaration to specify the name of a function
and its return type.  A function declaration ends with a semicolon.  Here is
the general form:



<PRE>
<VAR>return-type</VAR> <VAR>function-name</VAR> ( );
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>return-type</VAR> can be any of the primitive data
types (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC15">Primitive Data Types</A>), a structure type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC35">Structures</A>),
a union type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC46">Unions</A>), an enumeration type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC56">Enumerations</A>),
a pointer type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC30">Pointers</A>), or <CODE>void</CODE>.  A return type of
<CODE>void</CODE> indicates that the function does not return a value at all.


<P>
<VAR>function-name</VAR> can be any valid identifier (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC4">Identifiers</A>).


<P>
Here is an example of a function declaration for a function named
<CODE>double_value</CODE> which has a return type of <CODE>int</CODE>:



<PRE>
int double_value ( );
</PRE>

<P>
You should write the function declaration above the definition or first use of
the function.  You can put it in a header file and use the <CODE>#include</CODE>
directive to include that function declartion in any source code files that
use the function.




<H2><A NAME="SEC121">Function Prototypes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>


<P>
A function prototype is a function declaration with a list of the function
parameters.  Here is the general form:



<PRE>
<VAR>return-type</VAR> <VAR>function-name</VAR> (<VAR>parameter-list</VAR>);
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>parameter-list</VAR> consists of zero or more parameters, separated by commas.
Usually, each parameter consists of a data type, and optionally a name for the
parameter.  The data type can be any of the primitive data
types (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC15">Primitive Data Types</A>), a structure type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC35">Structures</A>),
a union type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC46">Unions</A>), an enumeration type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC56">Enumerations</A>),
an array type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC22">Arrays</A>), or a pointer type (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC30">Pointers</A>).  You
can also specify that a function have a variable number of parameters
(see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC127">Variable Length Parameter Lists</A>), or no parameters.  If it has no
parameters, either use <CODE>void</CODE> for the parameter list, or do not have a
parameter list at all.  


<P>
<VAR>return-type</VAR> and <VAR>function-name</VAR> are described in the function
declaration section.  See section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC120">Function Declarations</A>.


<P>
Here is an example of a function prototype with two parameters:



<PRE>
int add_values (int, int);
</PRE>

<P>
If you include a name for a parameter, the name immediately follows the
data type, like this:



<PRE>
int add_values (int x, int y);
</PRE>

<P>
The parameter names can be any identifier (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC4">Identifiers</A>), and if you
have more than one parameter, you can't use the same name more than
once within a single prototype.


<P>
You should write the function prototype above the definition or first use of
the function.  You can put it in a header file and use the <CODE>#include</CODE>
directive to include that function prototype in any source code files that
use the function.




<H2><A NAME="SEC122">Function Definitions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<A NAME="IDX219"></A>


<P>
You write a function definition to specify what a function
actually does.  A function definition consists of information regarding
the function's name, return type, and types and names of parameters, along
with the body of the function.  The function body is a series of statements
enclosed in braces.  Here is the general form of a function definition:



<PRE>
<VAR>return-type</VAR>
<VAR>function-name</VAR> (<VAR>parameter-list</VAR>)
{
  <VAR>function-body</VAR>
}
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>return-type</VAR> and <VAR>function-name</VAR> are described in the section
about function declarations (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC120">Function Declarations</A>), and you
should use the same return types and function names in a function
definition that you used in that function's declaration or prototype.


<P>
<VAR>parameter-list</VAR> is similar to the parameter list described in
the function prototype section (see section <A HREF="gnu-c-manual.html#SEC121">Function Prototypes</A>), except you
<EM>must</EM> include names for the parameters in a function definition.


<P>
Here is an simple example of a function definition--it takes two integers as
its parameters and returns the sum of them as its return value:



<PRE>
int
add_values (int x, int y)
{
  return x + y;
}
</PRE>

<P>
You can also specify the type of the function parameters on the <EM>after</EM>
the closing parentheses of the parameter list, like this:



<PRE>
int
add_values (x, y)
            int x, int y;
{
  return x + y;
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC123">Calling Functions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>


<P>
You can call a function by using its name and supplying any needed parameters.
Here is the general form of a function call:



<PRE>
<VAR>function-name</VAR> (<VAR>parameters</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
A function call can make up an entire statement, or it can be used as a
subexpression.  Here is an example of the former case:



<PRE>
print_integer ( 5 );
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, the function <SAMP>`print_integer'</SAMP> is called with the
parameter <CODE>5</CODE>.  We can suppose that this function prints out the
value 5 in some way, perhaps to the terminal.


<P>
Here is an example of a function call used as a subexpression; the
function <SAMP>`square_value'</SAMP> returns the square of its parameter:



<PRE>
a = square_integer ( 5 );
</PRE>

<P>
Supposing that the function <SAMP>`square_integer'</SAMP> works correctly, the
above example assigns the value 25 to <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>.


<P>
If a function takes more than one parameter, then when you call it, you must
separate parameters with commas.  Here is an example, using a function
that returns the sum of its two parameters:



<PRE>
a = sum_of_integers ( 5, 10 );
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC124">Function Parameters</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>


<P>
Function parameters can either be a constant value or a copy of variable, or
the address of a variable.  When you send a copy of a variable, you cannot
change the original variable that was used as the parameter, only the copy.
However, when you send the address of a variable, then you can manipulate
the original variable using pointers.


<P>
This section describes both of those situations, and also how to write
functions with variable length parameter lists--a function with an
indefinite number of parameters.




<H3><A NAME="SEC125">Pass By Value Parameters</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>


<P>
There are two different situations in which a parameter is considered to
be "passed by value":



<OL>
<LI>

When you pass a literal or some other constant value to a function.

<LI>

When you pass a non-pointer variable to a function.
</OL>

<P>
In both of these cases, the function cannot modify the original value or
variable that is passed to it.  Of course, constant values cannot be
modified at all, and when a variable is passed to a function, a copy of
that variable is made.  The function then operates on the copy.  Here is
an example:



<PRE>
int x = 23;

double_value ( x );

...

/* Definition for <CODE>double_value</CODE>. */

int double_value (int a)
{
  a = 2 * a;
  return a;
}
</PRE>

<P>
In that example, even though the parameter <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> is modified in the
function <SAMP>`double_value'</SAMP>, the variable <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> that is passed to
the function does not change.  For the call to <SAMP>`double_value'</SAMP>
to actually double the value of <SAMP>`x'</SAMP>, it would have to be incorporated
into an assignment statement, like this:



<PRE>
x = double_value ( x );
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC126">Pass By Reference Parameters</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>


<P>
You can pass a value to a function "by reference", which means that, instead
of sending a literal value or a copy of a variable, you send the address of
a variable.  This allows you to change the value of the variable from the
function, which is something you cannot do when the parameter is passed by
value.


<P>
To do this, you specify in the function definition (and prototype, if you use
one) that the parameter is a pointer, like this:



<PRE>
void swap_integers (int *a, int *b);
</PRE>

<P>
That example has two parameters, <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`b'</SAMP>, both of which are
pointers to <CODE>int</CODE> values.  When you call this function, instead of
passing it literal values or variables, you pass it the addresses of
variables, like this:



<PRE>
int x = 5, y = 10;

swap_integers ( &#38;x, &#38;y );
</PRE>

<P>
That way, in the function definition, you can actually change the values of
<SAMP>`x'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`y'</SAMP>, because you passed the function the addresses of
those variables.  Here is the definition of the <SAMP>`swap_integers'</SAMP> function,
which swaps the values held in two integer variables:



<PRE>
void
swap_integers (int *a, int *b)
{
  int temp;

  temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
  return;
}
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC127">Variable Length Parameter Lists</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
<A NAME="IDX232"></A>
<A NAME="IDX233"></A>


<P>
You can write a function that takes a variable number of arguments.  To
do this, the function needs to have at least one parameter of a known
data type, but the remaining parameters are optional, and can vary in both
quantity and data type.


<P>
You list the first parameter as normal, but then as the second parameter,
use an ellipsis: <SAMP>`...'</SAMP>.  Here is an example function prototype:



<PRE>
int add_multiple_values (int number, ...);
</PRE>

<P>
To work with the optional parameters in the function definition, you need
to use macro functions that are defined in the libary header file
<SAMP>`stdarg.h'</SAMP>.  So be sure to <CODE>include</CODE> that file.  Those functions
are described in <CITE>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE>, but here is
an example of using them:



<PRE>
int
add_multiple_values (int number, ...)
{
  int counter, total = 0;
  
  /* Declare a variable of type <SAMP>`va_list'</SAMP>. */
  va_list parameters;

  /* Call the <SAMP>`va_start'</SAMP> function. */
  va_start (parameters, number);

  for (counter = 0; counter &#60; number; counter++)
    {
      /* Get the values of the optional parameters. */
      total += va_arg (parameters, int);
    }

  /* End use of the <SAMP>`parameters'</SAMP> variable. */
  va_end (parameters);

  return total;
}
</PRE>

<P>
To use optional parameters, you should have a way to know how many
there are.  This can vary, so it can't be hard-coded, but if you
don't know how many optional parameters you have, then you could
have difficulty knowing when to stop using the <SAMP>`va_arg'</SAMP> function.
In the above example, the first parameter to the <SAMP>`add_multiple_values'</SAMP>
function, <SAMP>`number'</SAMP>, was the number of optional parameters included.
So, we might call the function like this:



<PRE>
sum = add_multiple_values (3, 12, 34, 190);
</PRE>

<P>
The first parameter indicates how many optional parameters follow it.


<P>
Also, note that you don't actually need to use <SAMP>`va_end'</SAMP> function.
In fact, in GNU C, it doesn't do anything at all.  However, you might want
to include it for portability to other compilers.




<H2><A NAME="SEC128">The <CODE>main</CODE> Function</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>


<P>
Every program requires at least one function, called <SAMP>`main'</SAMP>.
This is where the program begins executing.  You do not need to write a
declaration or prototype for <SAMP>`main'</SAMP>, but you do need to define it.


<P>
The return type for <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> is always <CODE>int</CODE>.  You do not have
to specify the return type for <SAMP>`main'</SAMP>, but you can.  However, you
<EM>cannot</EM> specify that it has a return type other than <CODE>int</CODE>.
In general, you want to have <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> return 0.  Returning other
integers usually indicates that the program ended abnormally.  (You are
not required to explicitly return a value at all.)


<P>
You can write your <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> function to have no parameters, or to
accept parameters from the command line.  To have no parameters, you can
either specify <SAMP>`void'</SAMP> as the parameter list, or simply leave it
blank. 


<P>
Here is a very simple <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> function with no parameters:



<PRE>
int
main (void)
{
  printf ("Hi there!");
  return 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
To accept command line parameters, you need to have two parameters in the
<SAMP>`main'</SAMP> function, <SAMP>`int argc'</SAMP> followed by <SAMP>`char *argv[]'</SAMP>.  You
can change the names of those parameters, but they must have those data
types---<CODE>int</CODE> and array of pointers to <CODE>char</CODE>.  <SAMP>`argc'</SAMP> is the
number of command line parameters, including the name of the program itself.
<SAMP>`argv'</SAMP> is an array of the parameters, as character strings.
<SAMP>`argv[0]'</SAMP>, the first element in the array, is the name of the program
as typed at the command line; any following array elements are the
parameters that followed the name of the program.


<P>
Here is an example <SAMP>`main'</SAMP> function that accepts command line
parameters, and prints out what those parameters are:



<PRE>
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int counter;

  for (counter = 0; counter &#60; argc; counter++)
    {
      printf ("%s \n", argv[counter]);
    }
  
  return 0;
}
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC129">Recursive Functions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>


<P>
You can write a function that is recursive--a function that calls
itself.  Here is an example that computes the factorial of an integer:



<PRE>
int
factorial (int x)
{
  if (x == 1)
    {
      return x;
    }
  else
    {
      return ( x * factorial (x - 1) );
    }
}
</PRE>

<P>
Be careful that you do not write a function that is infinitely recursive.  In
the above example, once <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is 1, the recursion stops.  However, in the
following example, the recursion (in theory) does not stop:



<PRE>
int
watermelon (int x)
{
  return ( watermelon (x) );
}
</PRE>

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <EM>free</EM> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

<LI>

APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, @acronym{SGML} or @acronym{XML} using a publicly available
@acronym{DTD}, and standard-conforming simple @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include @acronym{PNG}, @acronym{XCF} and
@acronym{JPG}.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, @acronym{SGML} or
@acronym{XML} for which the @acronym{DTD} and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated @acronym{HTML},
PostScript or @acronym{PDF} produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

<LI>

VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

<LI>

COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

<LI>

MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:


<OL>
<LI>

Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

<LI>

List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

<LI>

State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

<LI>

Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

<LI>

Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

<LI>

Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

<LI>

Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

<LI>

Include an unaltered copy of this License.

<LI>

Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

<LI>

Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

<LI>

For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

<LI>

Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

<LI>

Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

<LI>

Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

<LI>

Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</OL>

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

<LI>

COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements."

<LI>

COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

<LI>

AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

<LI>

TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

<LI>

TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</A>.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
</OL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC131">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</A></H2>

<P>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:



<PRE>
  Copyright (C)  <VAR>year</VAR>  <VAR>your name</VAR>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</PRE>

<P>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:



<PRE>
    with the Invariant Sections being <VAR>list their titles</VAR>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <VAR>list</VAR>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <VAR>list</VAR>.
</PRE>

<P>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.


<P>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
