<p>This is a reference manual for the GNU C programming language (C as implemented
by the GNU C compiler), and is currently <strong>IN PROGRESS</strong>.  This version of
the manual is <strong>NOT</strong> the finished work.

   <p>The chapter on the C preprocessor is a modified version of the GNU CPP
manual, written by Richard M. Stallman and Zachary Weinberg.  The remaining
material in this manual was mostly written by Trevis Rothwell, with some
bits snarfed from the GCC manual and emails from Richard Stallman.

<h2 class="chapter">Overview of C Programming</h2>

<p>For those that are new to C, let's take a quick look at C programming
before jumping right into the reference material.  This is by no means
a comprehensive tutorial, but it should serve to orient you to some key
concepts.

   <p>In general, C is a compiled programming language.  This means that you
write your source code files using a text editor, and then compile them
into an executable program.  The classic example C program prints the
phrase "hello, world" on the system console.  Here is the source code
for a program that does just that:

<pre class="example">     /* hello.c */
     
     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       printf ("hello, world!");
       return 0;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>This is a pretty humble beginning, but it illustrates several important
concepts in C programming.

   <p>First, notice the line that reads <code>/* hello.c */</code>.  This is a comment
in the C program.  All comments are replaced by a single space by the
C preprocessor, which is run by default when you compile your program.  So
comments have no effect on what the program actually does.

   <p>The second line, <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>, is also handled by the
preprocessor.  In this case, though, that one line is replaced by the
contents of an entire file, namely <code>stdio.h</code>.  Inclusions like this
allow you to make use of source code stored in other files.  In this case,
including <code>stdio.h</code> gives our program access to a number of input and
output functions.

   <p>All C programs need to have at least one function, called <code>main</code>.  This
is where a program's execution begins.  In our sample program, the <code>main</code>
function receives no parameters (indicated by the word <code>void</code>) and returns
an integer value (indicated by the word <code>int</code>).

   <p>Our <code>main</code> function only does two things:  it prints the phrase
"hello, world" to the console, and returns the integer 0.  To print the
phrase, we use the output function <code>printf</code>, which is declared in the
<code>stdio.h</code> file that we included earlier in the program.

   <p>The integer 0 is returned to the operating system, indicating that the
program completed successfully.

   <p>Once you have this program typed into a text editor and saved as a file
(such as <code>hello.c</code>), you can compile it into an executable file.  The
GNU C compiler is called <code>gcc</code>, and you can use it to compile the
program like this:

<pre class="example">     gcc hello.c -o hello
     </pre>

   <p>This produces the output file <code>hello</code>, which you can run from the
console, and from it receive a classic computer greeting!

<h2 class="unnumbered">The C Preprocessor</h2>

<p>The first stage of building an executable program out of C source code
is called preprocessing. 
The GNU C preprocessor implements the macro language used to transform C,
C++, and Objective-C programs before they are compiled.  It can also be
useful on its own.

<h3 class="section">Overview</h3>

<p>The C preprocessor, often known as <dfn>cpp</dfn>, is a <dfn>macro processor</dfn>
that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program
before compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows
you to define <dfn>macros</dfn>, which are brief abbreviations for longer
constructs.

   <p>The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and
Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a general
text processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C's lexical
rules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginning of
character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it
preserving characteristics of the input which are not significant to
C-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs
will be removed, and the Makefile will not work.

   <p>Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things which
are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe
(Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  <code>-traditional-cpp</code>
mode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.  Many
of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style comments
instead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.

   <p>Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the language
you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macro
facilities.  Most high level programming languages have their own
conditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,
try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.

   <p>C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU C
preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISO
Standard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do a
few things required by the standard.  These are features which are
rarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaning
of a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C,
you should use the <code>-std=c89</code> or <code>-std=c99</code> options, depending
on which version of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory
diagnostics, you must also use <code>-pedantic</code>.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.

   <p>This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To
minimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's
behavior does not conflict with traditional semantics, the
traditional preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various
differences that do exist are detailed in the section <a href="#Traditional%20Mode">Traditional Mode</a>.

   <p>For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references to <code>CPP</code> in this
manual refer to GNU CPP.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Initial processing</h4>

<p>The preprocessor performs a series of textual transformations on its
input.  These happen before all other processing.  Conceptually, they
happen in a rigid order, and the entire file is run through each
transformation before the next one begins.  CPP actually does them
all at once, for performance reasons.  These transformations correspond
roughly to the first three "phases of translation" described in the C
standard.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The input file is read into memory and broken into lines.

     <p>CPP expects its input to be a text file, that is, an unstructured
stream of ASCII characters, with some characters indicating the end of a
line of text.  Extended ASCII character sets, such as ISO Latin-1 or
Unicode encoded in UTF-8, are also acceptable.  Character sets that are
not strict supersets of seven-bit ASCII will not work.  We plan to add
complete support for international character sets in a future release.

     <p>Different systems use different conventions to indicate the end of a
line.  GCC accepts the ASCII control sequences <kbd>LF</kbd>, <kbd>CR&nbsp;LF</kbd>, <kbd>CR</kbd>, and <kbd>LF&nbsp;CR</kbd> as end-of-line markers.  The first
three are the canonical sequences used by Unix, DOS and VMS, and the
classic Mac OS (before OSX) respectively.  You may therefore safely copy
source code written on any of those systems to a different one and use
it without conversion.  (GCC may lose track of the current line number
if a file doesn't consistently use one convention, as sometimes happens
when it is edited on computers with different conventions that share a
network file system.)  <kbd>LF&nbsp;CR</kbd> is included because it has been
reported as an end-of-line marker under exotic conditions.

     <p>If the last line of any input file lacks an end-of-line marker, the end
of the file is considered to implicitly supply one.  The C standard says
that this condition provokes undefined behavior, so GCC will emit a
warning message.

     </p><li><a name="trigraphs"></a>If trigraphs are enabled, they are replaced by their
corresponding single characters.  By default GCC ignores trigraphs,
but if you request a strictly conforming mode with the <code>-std</code>
option, or you specify the <code>-trigraphs</code> option, then it
converts them.

     <p>These are nine three-character sequences, all starting with <code>??</code>,
that are defined by ISO C to stand for single characters.  They permit
obsolete systems that lack some of C's punctuation to use C.  For
example, <code>??/</code> stands for <code>\</code>, so <tt>'??/n'</tt> is a character
constant for a newline.

     <p>Trigraphs are not popular and many compilers implement them incorrectly. 
Portable code should not rely on trigraphs being either converted or
ignored.  If you use the <code>-Wall</code> or <code>-Wtrigraphs</code> options,
GCC will warn you when a trigraph would change the meaning of your
program if it were converted.

     <p>In a string constant, you can prevent a sequence of question marks from
being confused with a trigraph by inserting a backslash between the
question marks.  <tt>"(??\?)"</tt> is the string <code>(???)</code>, not
<code>(?]</code>.  Traditional C compilers do not recognize this idiom.

     <p>The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

     <pre class="example">          Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
          Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~
          </pre>

     </p><li>Continued lines are merged into one long line.

     <p>A continued line is a line which ends with a backslash, <code>\</code>.  The
backslash is removed and the following line is joined with the current
one.  No space is inserted, so you may split a line anywhere, even in
the middle of a word.  (It is generally more readable to split lines
only at white space.)

     <p>The trailing backslash on a continued line is commonly referred to as a
<dfn>backslash-newline</dfn>.

     <p>If there is white space between a backslash and the end of a line, that
is still a continued line.  However, as this is usually the result of an
editing mistake, and many compilers will not accept it as a continued
line, GCC will warn you about it.

     </p><li>All comments are replaced with single spaces.

     <p>There are two kinds of comments.  <dfn>Block comments</dfn> begin with
<code>/*</code> and continue until the next <code>*/</code>.  Block comments do not
nest:

     <pre class="example">          /* this is /* one comment */ text outside comment
          </pre>

     <p><dfn>Line comments</dfn> begin with <code>//</code> and continue to the end of the
current line.  Line comments do not nest either, but it does not matter,
because they would end in the same place anyway.

     <pre class="example">          // this is // one comment
          text outside comment
          </pre>
     </ol>

   <p>It is safe to put line comments inside block comments, or vice versa.

<pre class="example">     /* block comment
        // contains line comment
        yet more comment
      */ outside comment
     
     // line comment /* contains block comment */
     </pre>

   <p>But beware of commenting out one end of a block comment with a line
comment.

<pre class="example">      // l.c.  /* block comment begins
         oops! this isn't a comment anymore */
     </pre>

   <p>Comments are not recognized within string literals. 
<tt>"/*&nbsp;blah&nbsp;*/"</tt> is the string constant <code>/*&nbsp;blah&nbsp;*/</code>, not
an empty string.

   <p>Line comments are not in the 1989 edition of the C standard, but they
are recognized by GCC as an extension.  In C++ and in the 1999 edition
of the C standard, they are an official part of the language.

   <p>Since these transformations happen before all other processing, you can
split a line mechanically with backslash-newline anywhere.  You can
comment out the end of a line.  You can continue a line comment onto the
next line with backslash-newline.  You can even split <code>/*</code>,
<code>*/</code>, and <code>//</code> onto multiple lines with backslash-newline. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     /\
     *
     */ # /*
     */ defi\
     ne FO\
     O 10\
     20
     </pre>

<p>is equivalent to <code>#define&nbsp;FOO&nbsp;1020</code>.  All these tricks are
extremely confusing and should not be used in code intended to be
readable.

   <p>There is no way to prevent a backslash at the end of a line from being
interpreted as a backslash-newline.  This cannot affect any correct
program, however.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Tokenization</h4>

<p>After the textual transformations are finished, the input file is
converted into a sequence of <dfn>preprocessing tokens</dfn>.  These mostly
correspond to the syntactic tokens used by the C compiler, but there are
a few differences.  White space separates tokens; it is not itself a
token of any kind.  Tokens do not have to be separated by white space,
but it is often necessary to avoid ambiguities.

   <p>When faced with a sequence of characters that has more than one possible
tokenization, the preprocessor is greedy.  It always makes each token,
starting from the left, as big as possible before moving on to the next
token.  For instance, <code>a+++++b</code> is interpreted as
<code>a&nbsp;++&nbsp;++&nbsp;+&nbsp;b</code>, not as <code>a&nbsp;++&nbsp;+&nbsp;++&nbsp;b</code>, even though the
latter tokenization could be part of a valid C program and the former
could not.

   <p>Once the input file is broken into tokens, the token boundaries never
change, except when the <code>##</code> preprocessing operator is used to paste
tokens together.  See <a href="#Concatenation">Concatenation</a>.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define foo() bar
     foo()baz
          ==&gt; bar baz
     <em>not</em>
          ==&gt; barbaz
     </pre>

   <p>The compiler does not re-tokenize the preprocessor's output.  Each
preprocessing token becomes one compiler token.

   <p>Preprocessing tokens fall into five broad classes: identifiers,
preprocessing numbers, string literals, punctuators, and other.  An
<dfn>identifier</dfn> is the same as an identifier in C: any sequence of
letters, digits, or underscores, which begins with a letter or
underscore.  Keywords of C have no significance to the preprocessor;
they are ordinary identifiers.  You can define a macro whose name is a
keyword, for instance.  The only identifier which can be considered a
preprocessing keyword is <code>defined</code>.  See <a href="#Defined">Defined</a>.

   <p>This is mostly true of other languages which use the C preprocessor. 
However, a few of the keywords of C++ are significant even in the
preprocessor.  See <a href="#C++%20Named%20Operators">C++ Named Operators</a>.

   <p>In the 1999 C standard, identifiers may contain letters which are not
part of the "basic source character set," at the implementation's
discretion (such as accented Latin letters, Greek letters, or Chinese
ideograms).  This may be done with an extended character set, or the
<code>\u</code> and <code>\U</code> escape sequences.  GCC does not presently
implement either feature in the preprocessor or the compiler.

   <p>As an extension, GCC treats <code>$</code> as a letter.  This is for
compatibility with some systems, such as VMS, where <code>$</code> is commonly
used in system-defined function and object names.  <code>$</code> is not a
letter in strictly conforming mode, or if you specify the <code>-$</code>
option.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.

   <p>A <dfn>preprocessing number</dfn> has a rather bizarre definition.  The
category includes all the normal integer and floating point constants
one expects of C, but also a number of other things one might not
initially recognize as a number.  Formally, preprocessing numbers begin
with an optional period, a required decimal digit, and then continue
with any sequence of letters, digits, underscores, periods, and
exponents.  Exponents are the two-character sequences <code>e+</code>,
<code>e-</code>, <code>E+</code>, <code>E-</code>, <code>p+</code>, <code>p-</code>, <code>P+</code>, and
<code>P-</code>.  (The exponents that begin with <code>p</code> or <code>P</code> are new
to C99.  They are used for hexadecimal floating-point constants.)

   <p>The purpose of this unusual definition is to isolate the preprocessor
from the full complexity of numeric constants.  It does not have to
distinguish between lexically valid and invalid floating-point numbers,
which is complicated.  The definition also permits you to split an
identifier at any position and get exactly two tokens, which can then be
pasted back together with the <code>##</code> operator.

   <p>It's possible for preprocessing numbers to cause programs to be
misinterpreted.  For example, <code>0xE+12</code> is a preprocessing number
which does not translate to any valid numeric constant, therefore a
syntax error.  It does not mean <code>0xE&nbsp;+&nbsp;12</code>, which is what you
might have intended.

   <p><dfn>String literals</dfn> are string constants, character constants, and
header file names (the argument of <code>#include</code>).<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  String constants and character
constants are straightforward: <tt>"<small class="dots">...</small>"</tt> or <tt>'<small class="dots">...</small>'</tt>.  In
either case embedded quotes should be escaped with a backslash:
<tt>'\''</tt> is the character constant for <code>'</code>.  There is no limit on
the length of a character constant, but the value of a character
constant that contains more than one character is
implementation-defined.  See <a href="#Implementation%20Details">Implementation Details</a>.

   <p>Header file names either look like string constants, <tt>"<small class="dots">...</small>"</tt>, or are
written with angle brackets instead, <tt>&lt;<small class="dots">...</small>&gt;</tt>.  In either case,
backslash is an ordinary character.  There is no way to escape the
closing quote or angle bracket.  The preprocessor looks for the header
file in different places depending on which form you use.  See <a href="#Include%20Operation">Include Operation</a>.

   <p>No string literal may extend past the end of a line.  Older versions
of GCC accepted multi-line string constants.  You may use continued
lines instead, or string constant concatenation.  See <a href="#Differences%20from%20previous%20versions">Differences from previous versions</a>.

   <p><dfn>Punctuators</dfn> are all the usual bits of punctuation which are
meaningful to C and C++.  All but three of the punctuation characters in
ASCII are C punctuators.  The exceptions are <code>@</code>, <code>$</code>, and
<code>`</code>.  In addition, all the two- and three-character operators are
punctuators.  There are also six <dfn>digraphs</dfn>, which the C++ standard
calls <dfn>alternative tokens</dfn>, which are merely alternate ways to spell
other punctuators.  This is a second attempt to work around missing
punctuation in obsolete systems.  It has no negative side effects,
unlike trigraphs, but does not cover as much ground.  The digraphs and
their corresponding normal punctuators are:

<pre class="example">     Digraph:        &lt;%  %&gt;  &lt;:  :&gt;  %:  %:%:
     Punctuator:      {   }   [   ]   #    ##
     </pre>

   <p>Any other single character is considered "other." It is passed on to
the preprocessor's output unmolested.  The C compiler will almost
certainly reject source code containing "other" tokens.  In ASCII, the
only other characters are <code>@</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>`</code>, and control
characters other than NUL (all bits zero).  (Note that <code>$</code> is
normally considered a letter.)  All characters with the high bit set
(numeric range 0x7F-0xFF) are also "other" in the present
implementation.  This will change when proper support for international
character sets is added to GCC.

   <p>NUL is a special case because of the high probability that its
appearance is accidental, and because it may be invisible to the user
(many terminals do not display NUL at all).  Within comments, NULs are
silently ignored, just as any other character would be.  In running
text, NUL is considered white space.  For example, these two directives
have the same meaning.

<pre class="example">     #define X^@1
     #define X 1
     </pre>

<p>(where <code>^@</code> is ASCII NUL).  Within string or character constants,
NULs are preserved.  In the latter two cases the preprocessor emits a
warning message.

<h3 class="subsection">The preprocessing language</h4>

<p>After tokenization, the stream of tokens may simply be passed straight
to the compiler's parser.  However, if it contains any operations in the
<dfn>preprocessing language</dfn>, it will be transformed first.  This stage
corresponds roughly to the standard's "translation phase 4" and is
what most people think of as the preprocessor's job.

   <p>The preprocessing language consists of <dfn>directives</dfn> to be executed
and <dfn>macros</dfn> to be expanded.  Its primary capabilities are:

     <ul>
<li>Inclusion of header files.  These are files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program.

     <li>Macro expansion.  You can define <dfn>macros</dfn>, which are abbreviations
for arbitrary fragments of C code.  The preprocessor will replace the
macros with their definitions throughout the program.  Some macros are
automatically defined for you.

     <li>Conditional compilation.  You can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions.

     <li>Line control.  If you use a program to combine or rearrange source files
into an intermediate file which is then compiled, you can use line
control to inform the compiler where each source line originally came
from.

     <li>Diagnostics.  You can detect problems at compile time and issue errors
or warnings. 
</ul>

   <p>There are a few more, less useful, features.

   <p>Except for expansion of predefined macros, all these operations are
triggered with <dfn>preprocessing directives</dfn>.  Preprocessing directives
are lines in your program that start with <code>#</code>.  Whitespace is
allowed before and after the <code>#</code>.  The <code>#</code> is followed by an
identifier, the <dfn>directive name</dfn>.  It specifies the operation to
perform.  Directives are commonly referred to as <code>#</code><var>name</var><code></code>
where <var>name</var> is the directive name.  For example, <code>#define</code> is
the directive that defines a macro.

   <p>The <code>#</code> which begins a directive cannot come from a macro
expansion.  Also, the directive name is not macro expanded.  Thus, if
<code>foo</code> is defined as a macro expanding to <code>define</code>, that does
not make <code>#foo</code> a valid preprocessing directive.

   <p>The set of valid directive names is fixed.  Programs cannot define new
preprocessing directives.

   <p>Some directives require arguments; these make up the rest of the
directive line and must be separated from the directive name by
whitespace.  For example, <code>#define</code> must be followed by a macro
name and the intended expansion of the macro.

   <p>A preprocessing directive cannot cover more than one line.  The line
may, however, be continued with backslash-newline, or by a block comment
which extends past the end of the line.  In either case, when the
directive is processed, the continuations have already been merged with
the first line to make one long line.

<h3 class="section">Header Files</h3>

<p>A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions
(see <a href="#Macros">Macros</a>) to be shared between several source files.  You request
the use of a header file in your program by <dfn>including</dfn> it, with the
C preprocessing directive <code>#include</code>.

   <p>Header files serve two purposes.

     <ul>
<li>System header files declare the interfaces to parts of the operating
system.  You include them in your program to supply the definitions and
declarations you need to invoke system calls and libraries.

     <li>Your own header files contain declarations for interfaces between the
source files of your program.  Each time you have a group of related
declarations and macro definitions all or most of which are needed in
several different source files, it is a good idea to create a header
file for them. 
</ul>

   <p>Including a header file produces the same results as copying the header
file into each source file that needs it.  Such copying would be
time-consuming and error-prone.  With a header file, the related
declarations appear in only one place.  If they need to be changed, they
can be changed in one place, and programs that include the header file
will automatically use the new version when next recompiled.  The header
file eliminates the labor of finding and changing all the copies as well
as the risk that a failure to find one copy will result in
inconsistencies within a program.

   <p>In C, the usual convention is to give header files names that end with
<code>.h</code>.  It is most portable to use only letters, digits, dashes, and
underscores in header file names, and at most one dot.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Include Syntax</h4>

<p>Both user and system header files are included using the preprocessing
directive <code>#include</code>.  It has two variants:

     <dl>
<dt><code>#include &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code>
     <dd>This variant is used for system header files.  It searches for a file
named <var>file</var> in a standard list of system directories.  You can prepend
directories to this list with the <code>-I</code> option (see <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>).

     <br><dt><code>#include "</code><var>file</var><code>"</code>
     <dd>This variant is used for header files of your own program.  It searches
for a file named <var>file</var> first in the directory containing the
current file, then in the same directories used for <code>&lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code>. 
</dl>

   <p>The argument of <code>#include</code>, whether delimited with quote marks or
angle brackets, behaves like a string constant in that comments are not
recognized, and macro names are not expanded.  Thus, <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;x/*y&gt;</code> specifies inclusion of a system header file named <code>x/*y</code>.

   <p>However, if backslashes occur within <var>file</var>, they are considered
ordinary text characters, not escape characters.  None of the character
escape sequences appropriate to string constants in C are processed. 
Thus, <code>#include&nbsp;"x\n\\y"</code> specifies a filename containing three
backslashes.  (Some systems interpret <code>\</code> as a pathname separator. 
All of these also interpret <code>/</code> the same way.  It is most portable
to use only <code>/</code>.)

   <p>It is an error if there is anything (other than comments) on the line
after the file name.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Include Operation</h4>

<p>The <code>#include</code> directive works by directing the C preprocessor to
scan the specified file as input before continuing with the rest of the
current file.  The output from the preprocessor contains the output
already generated, followed by the output resulting from the included
file, followed by the output that comes from the text after the
<code>#include</code> directive.  For example, if you have a header file
<code>header.h</code> as follows,

<pre class="example">     char *test (void);
     </pre>

<p>and a main program called <code>program.c</code> that uses the header file,
like this,

<pre class="example">     int x;
     #include "header.h"
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       puts (test ());
     }
     </pre>

<p>the compiler will see the same token stream as it would if
<code>program.c</code> read

<pre class="example">     int x;
     char *test (void);
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       puts (test ());
     }
     </pre>

   <p>Included files are not limited to declarations and macro definitions;
those are merely the typical uses.  Any fragment of a C program can be
included from another file.  The include file could even contain the
beginning of a statement that is concluded in the containing file, or
the end of a statement that was started in the including file.  However,
an included file must consist of complete tokens.  Comments and string
literals which have not been closed by the end of an included file are
invalid.  For error recovery, they are considered to end at the end of
the file.

   <p>To avoid confusion, it is best if header files contain only complete
syntactic units--function declarations or definitions, type
declarations, etc.

   <p>The line following the <code>#include</code> directive is always treated as a
separate line by the C preprocessor, even if the included file lacks a
final newline.

<h3 class="subsection">Search Path</h4>

<p>GCC looks in several different places for headers.  On a normal Unix
system, if you do not instruct it otherwise, it will look for headers
requested with <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code> in:

<pre class="example">     /usr/local/include
     /usr/lib/gcc-lib/<var>target</var>/<var>version</var>/include
     /usr/<var>target</var>/include
     /usr/include
     </pre>

   <p>For C++ programs, it will also look in <code>/usr/include/g++-v3</code>,
first.  In the above, <var>target</var> is the canonical name of the system
GCC was configured to compile code for; often but not always the same as
the canonical name of the system it runs on.  <var>version</var> is the
version of GCC in use.

   <p>You can add to this list with the <code>-I</code><var>dir</var><code></code> command line
option.  All the directories named by <code>-I</code> are searched, in
left-to-right order, <em>before</em> the default directories.  The only
exception is when <code>dir</code> is already searched by default.  In
this case, the option is ignored and the search order for system
directories remains unchanged.

   <p>Duplicate directories are removed from the quote and bracket search
chains before the two chains are merged to make the final search chain. 
Thus, it is possible for a directory to occur twice in the final search
chain if it was specified in both the quote and bracket chains.

   <p>You can prevent GCC from searching any of the default directories with
the <code>-nostdinc</code> option.  This is useful when you are compiling an
operating system kernel or some other program that does not use the
standard C library facilities, or the standard C library itself. 
<code>-I</code> options are not ignored as described above when
<code>-nostdinc</code> is in effect.

   <p>GCC looks for headers requested with <code>#include&nbsp;"</code><var>file</var><code>"</code>
first in the directory containing the current file, then in the same
places it would have looked for a header requested with angle brackets. 
For example, if <code>/usr/include/sys/stat.h</code> contains
<code>#include&nbsp;"types.h"</code>, GCC looks for <code>types.h</code> first in
<code>/usr/include/sys</code>, then in its usual search path.

   <p><code>#line</code> (see <a href="#Line%20Control">Line Control</a>) does not change GCC's idea of the
directory containing the current file.

   <p>You may put <code>-I-</code> at any point in your list of <code>-I</code> options. 
This has two effects.  First, directories appearing before the
<code>-I-</code> in the list are searched only for headers requested with
quote marks.  Directories after <code>-I-</code> are searched for all
headers.  Second, the directory containing the current file is not
searched for anything, unless it happens to be one of the directories
named by an <code>-I</code> switch.

   <p><code>-I. -I-</code> is not the same as no <code>-I</code> options at all, and does
not cause the same behavior for <code>&lt;&gt;</code> includes that <code>""</code>
includes get with no special options.  <code>-I.</code> searches the
compiler's current working directory for header files.  That may or may
not be the same as the directory containing the current file.

   <p>If you need to look for headers in a directory named <code>-</code>, write
<code>-I./-</code>.

   <p>There are several more ways to adjust the header search path.  They are
generally less useful.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Once-Only Headers</h4>

<p>If a header file happens to be included twice, the compiler will process
its contents twice.  This is very likely to cause an error, e.g. when the
compiler sees the same structure definition twice.  Even if it does not,
it will certainly waste time.

   <p>The standard way to prevent this is to enclose the entire real contents
of the file in a conditional, like this:

<pre class="example">     /* File foo.  */
     #ifndef FILE_FOO_SEEN
     #define FILE_FOO_SEEN
     
     <var>the entire file</var>
     
     #endif /* !FILE_FOO_SEEN */
     </pre>

   <p>This construct is commonly known as a <dfn>wrapper #ifndef</dfn>. 
When the header is included again, the conditional will be false,
because <code>FILE_FOO_SEEN</code> is defined.  The preprocessor will skip
over the entire contents of the file, and the compiler will not see it
twice.

   <p>CPP optimizes even further.  It remembers when a header file has a
wrapper <code>#ifndef</code>.  If a subsequent <code>#include</code> specifies that
header, and the macro in the <code>#ifndef</code> is still defined, it does
not bother to rescan the file at all.

   <p>You can put comments outside the wrapper.  They will not interfere with
this optimization.

   <p>The macro <code>FILE_FOO_SEEN</code> is called the <dfn>controlling macro</dfn> or
<dfn>guard macro</dfn>.  In a user header file, the macro name should not
begin with <code>_</code>.  In a system header file, it should begin with
<code>__</code> to avoid conflicts with user programs.  In any kind of header
file, the macro name should contain the name of the file and some
additional text, to avoid conflicts with other header files.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Computed Includes</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to select one of several different header
files to be included into your program.  They might specify
configuration parameters to be used on different sorts of operating
systems, for instance.  You could do this with a series of conditionals,

<pre class="example">     #if SYSTEM_1
     # include "system_1.h"
     #elif SYSTEM_2
     # include "system_2.h"
     #elif SYSTEM_3
     ...
     #endif
     </pre>

   <p>That rapidly becomes tedious.  Instead, the preprocessor offers the
ability to use a macro for the header name.  This is called a
<dfn>computed include</dfn>.  Instead of writing a header name as the direct
argument of <code>#include</code>, you simply put a macro name there instead:

<pre class="example">     #define SYSTEM_H "system_1.h"
     ...
     #include SYSTEM_H
     </pre>

<p><code>SYSTEM_H</code> will be expanded, and the preprocessor will look for
<code>system_1.h</code> as if the <code>#include</code> had been written that way
originally.  <code>SYSTEM_H</code> could be defined by your Makefile with a
<code>-D</code> option.

   <p>You must be careful when you define the macro.  <code>#define</code> saves
tokens, not text.  The preprocessor has no way of knowing that the macro
will be used as the argument of <code>#include</code>, so it generates
ordinary tokens, not a header name.  This is unlikely to cause problems
if you use double-quote includes, which are close enough to string
constants.  If you use angle brackets, however, you may have trouble.

   <p>The syntax of a computed include is actually a bit more general than the
above.  If the first non-whitespace character after <code>#include</code> is
not <code>"</code> or <code>&lt;</code>, then the entire line is macro-expanded
like running text would be.

   <p>If the line expands to a single string constant, the contents of that
string constant are the file to be included.  CPP does not re-examine the
string for embedded quotes, but neither does it process backslash
escapes in the string.  Therefore

<pre class="example">     #define HEADER "a\"b"
     #include HEADER
     </pre>

<p>looks for a file named <code>a\"b</code>.  CPP searches for the file according
to the rules for double-quoted includes.

   <p>If the line expands to a token stream beginning with a <code>&lt;</code> token
and including a <code>&gt;</code> token, then the tokens between the <code>&lt;</code> and
the first <code>&gt;</code> are combined to form the filename to be included. 
Any whitespace between tokens is reduced to a single space; then any
space after the initial <code>&lt;</code> is retained, but a trailing space
before the closing <code>&gt;</code> is ignored.  CPP searches for the file
according to the rules for angle-bracket includes.

   <p>In either case, if there are any tokens on the line after the file name,
an error occurs and the directive is not processed.  It is also an error
if the result of expansion does not match either of the two expected
forms.

   <p>These rules are implementation-defined behavior according to the C
standard.  To minimize the risk of different compilers interpreting your
computed includes differently, we recommend you use only a single
object-like macro which expands to a string constant.  This will also
minimize confusion for people reading your program.

<h3 class="subsection">Wrapper Headers</h4>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the contents of a system-provided
header file without editing it directly.  GCC's <code>fixincludes</code>
operation does this, for example.  One way to do that would be to create
a new header file with the same name and insert it in the search path
before the original header.  That works fine as long as you're willing
to replace the old header entirely.  But what if you want to refer to
the old header from the new one?

   <p>You cannot simply include the old header with <code>#include</code>.  That
will start from the beginning, and find your new header again.  If your
header is not protected from multiple inclusion (see <a href="#Once-Only%20Headers">Once-Only Headers</a>), it will recurse infinitely and cause a fatal error.

   <p>You could include the old header with an absolute pathname:
<pre class="example">     #include "/usr/include/old-header.h"
     </pre>

<p>This works, but is not clean; should the system headers ever move, you
would have to edit the new headers to match.

   <p>There is no way to solve this problem within the C standard, but you can
use the GNU extension <code>#include_next</code>.  It means, "Include the
<em>next</em> file with this name."  This directive works like
<code>#include</code> except in searching for the specified file: it starts
searching the list of header file directories <em>after</em> the directory
in which the current file was found.

   <p>Suppose you specify <code>-I /usr/local/include</code>, and the list of
directories to search also includes <code>/usr/include</code>; and suppose
both directories contain <code>signal.h</code>.  Ordinary <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;signal.h&gt;</code> finds the file under <code>/usr/local/include</code>.  If that
file contains <code>#include_next&nbsp;&lt;signal.h&gt;</code>, it starts searching
after that directory, and finds the file in <code>/usr/include</code>.

   <p><code>#include_next</code> does not distinguish between <code>&lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code>
and <code>"</code><var>file</var><code>"</code> inclusion, nor does it check that the file you
specify has the same name as the current file.  It simply looks for the
file named, starting with the directory in the search path after the one
where the current file was found.

   <p>The use of <code>#include_next</code> can lead to great confusion.  We
recommend it be used only when there is no other alternative.  In
particular, it should not be used in the headers belonging to a specific
program; it should be used only to make global corrections along the
lines of <code>fixincludes</code>.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">System Headers</h4>

<p>The header files declaring interfaces to the operating system and
runtime libraries often cannot be written in strictly conforming C. 
Therefore, GCC gives code found in <dfn>system headers</dfn> special
treatment.  All warnings, other than those generated by <code>#warning</code>
(see <a href="#Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a>), are suppressed while GCC is processing a system
header.  Macros defined in a system header are immune to a few warnings
wherever they are expanded.  This immunity is granted on an ad-hoc
basis, when we find that a warning generates lots of false positives
because of code in macros defined in system headers.

   <p>Normally, only the headers found in specific directories are considered
system headers.  These directories are determined when GCC is compiled. 
There are, however, two ways to make normal headers into system headers.

   <p>The <code>-isystem</code> command line option adds its argument to the list of
directories to search for headers, just like <code>-I</code>.  Any headers
found in that directory will be considered system headers.

   <p>All directories named by <code>-isystem</code> are searched <em>after</em> all
directories named by <code>-I</code>, no matter what their order was on the
command line.  If the same directory is named by both <code>-I</code> and
<code>-isystem</code>, the <code>-I</code> option is ignored.  GCC provides an
informative message when this occurs if <code>-v</code> is used.

   <p>There is also a directive, <code>#pragma&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;system_header</code>, which
tells GCC to consider the rest of the current include file a system
header, no matter where it was found.  Code that comes before the
<code>#pragma</code> in the file will not be affected.  <code>#pragma&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;system_header</code> has no effect in the primary source file.

   <p>On very old systems, some of the pre-defined system header directories
get even more special treatment.  GNU C++ considers code in headers
found in those directories to be surrounded by an <code>extern&nbsp;"C"</code>
block.  There is no way to request this behavior with a <code>#pragma</code>,
or from the command line.

<h3 class="section">Macros</h3>

<p>A <dfn>macro</dfn> is a fragment of code which has been given a name. 
Whenever the name is used, it is replaced by the contents of the macro. 
There are two kinds of macros.  They differ mostly in what they look
like when they are used.  <dfn>Object-like</dfn> macros resemble data objects
when used, <dfn>function-like</dfn> macros resemble function calls.

   <p>You may define any valid identifier as a macro, even if it is a C
keyword.  The preprocessor does not know anything about keywords.  This
can be useful if you wish to hide a keyword such as <code>const</code> from an
older compiler that does not understand it.  However, the preprocessor
operator <code>defined</code> (see <a href="#Defined">Defined</a>) can never be defined as a
macro, and C++'s named operators (see <a href="#C++%20Named%20Operators">C++ Named Operators</a>) cannot be
macros when you are compiling C++.

<h3 class="subsection">Object-like Macros</h4>

<p>An <dfn>object-like macro</dfn> is a simple identifier which will be replaced
by a code fragment.  It is called object-like because it looks like a
data object in code that uses it.  They are most commonly used to give
symbolic names to numeric constants.

   <p>You create macros with the <code>#define</code> directive.  <code>#define</code> is
followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should
be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macro's
<dfn>body</dfn>, <dfn>expansion</dfn> or <dfn>replacement list</dfn>.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
     </pre>

<p>defines a macro named <code>BUFFER_SIZE</code> as an abbreviation for the
token <code>1024</code>.  If somewhere after this <code>#define</code> directive
there comes a C statement of the form

<pre class="example">     foo = (char *) malloc (BUFFER_SIZE);
     </pre>

<p>then the C preprocessor will recognize and <dfn>expand</dfn> the macro
<code>BUFFER_SIZE</code>.  The C compiler will see the same tokens as it would
if you had written

<pre class="example">     foo = (char *) malloc (1024);
     </pre>

   <p>By convention, macro names are written in upper case.  Programs are
easier to read when it is possible to tell at a glance which names are
macros.

   <p>The macro's body ends at the end of the <code>#define</code> line.  You may
continue the definition onto multiple lines, if necessary, using
backslash-newline.  When the macro is expanded, however, it will all
come out on one line.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define NUMBERS 1, \
                     2, \
                     3
     int x[] = { NUMBERS };
          ==&gt; int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
     </pre>

<p>The most common visible consequence of this is surprising line numbers
in error messages.

   <p>There is no restriction on what can go in a macro body provided it
decomposes into valid preprocessing tokens.  Parentheses need not
balance, and the body need not resemble valid C code.  (If it does not,
you may get error messages from the C compiler when you use the macro.)

   <p>The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially.  Macro definitions
take effect at the place you write them.  Therefore, the following input
to the C preprocessor

<pre class="example">     foo = X;
     #define X 4
     bar = X;
     </pre>

<p>produces

<pre class="example">     foo = X;
     bar = 4;
     </pre>

   <p>When the preprocessor expands a macro name, the macro's expansion
replaces the macro invocation, then the expansion is examined for more
macros to expand.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     #define BUFSIZE 1024
     TABLESIZE
          ==&gt; BUFSIZE
          ==&gt; 1024
     </pre>

<p><code>TABLESIZE</code> is expanded first to produce <code>BUFSIZE</code>, then that
macro is expanded to produce the final result, <code>1024</code>.

   <p>Notice that <code>BUFSIZE</code> was not defined when <code>TABLESIZE</code> was
defined.  The <code>#define</code> for <code>TABLESIZE</code> uses exactly the
expansion you specify--in this case, <code>BUFSIZE</code>--and does not
check to see whether it too contains macro names.  Only when you
<em>use</em> <code>TABLESIZE</code> is the result of its expansion scanned for
more macro names.

   <p>This makes a difference if you change the definition of <code>BUFSIZE</code>
at some point in the source file.  <code>TABLESIZE</code>, defined as shown,
will always expand using the definition of <code>BUFSIZE</code> that is
currently in effect:

<pre class="example">     #define BUFSIZE 1020
     #define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
     #undef BUFSIZE
     #define BUFSIZE 37
     </pre>

<p>Now <code>TABLESIZE</code> expands (in two stages) to <code>37</code>.

   <p>If the expansion of a macro contains its own name, either directly or
via intermediate macros, it is not expanded again when the expansion is
examined for more macros.  This prevents infinite recursion. 
See <a href="#Self-Referential%20Macros">Self-Referential Macros</a>, for the precise details.

<h3 class="subsection">Function-like Macros</h4>

<p>You can also define macros whose use looks like a function call.  These
are called <dfn>function-like macros</dfn>.  To define a function-like macro,
you use the same <code>#define</code> directive, but you put a pair of
parentheses immediately after the macro name.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define lang_init()  c_init()
     lang_init()
          ==&gt; c_init()
     </pre>

   <p>A function-like macro is only expanded if its name appears with a pair
of parentheses after it.  If you write just the name, it is left alone. 
This can be useful when you have a function and a macro of the same
name, and you wish to use the function sometimes.

<pre class="example">     extern void foo(void);
     #define foo() /* optimized inline version */
     ...
       foo();
       funcptr = foo;
     </pre>

   <p>Here the call to <code>foo()</code> will use the macro, but the function
pointer will get the address of the real function.  If the macro were to
be expanded, it would cause a syntax error.

   <p>If you put spaces between the macro name and the parentheses in the
macro definition, that does not define a function-like macro, it defines
an object-like macro whose expansion happens to begin with a pair of
parentheses.

<pre class="example">     #define lang_init ()    c_init()
     lang_init()
          ==&gt; () c_init()()
     </pre>

   <p>The first two pairs of parentheses in this expansion come from the
macro.  The third is the pair that was originally after the macro
invocation.  Since <code>lang_init</code> is an object-like macro, it does not
consume those parentheses.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Macro Arguments</h4>

<p>Function-like macros can take <dfn>arguments</dfn>, just like true functions. 
To define a macro that uses arguments, you insert <dfn>parameters</dfn>
between the pair of parentheses in the macro definition that make the
macro function-like.  The parameters must be valid C identifiers,
separated by commas and optionally whitespace.

   <p>To invoke a macro that takes arguments, you write the name of the macro
followed by a list of <dfn>actual arguments</dfn> in parentheses, separated
by commas.  The invocation of the macro need not be restricted to a
single logical line--it can cross as many lines in the source file as
you wish.  The number of arguments you give must match the number of
parameters in the macro definition.  When the macro is expanded, each
use of a parameter in its body is replaced by the tokens of the
corresponding argument.  (You need not use all of the parameters in the
macro body.)

   <p>As an example, here is a macro that computes the minimum of two numeric
values, as it is defined in many C programs, and some uses.

<pre class="example">     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) &lt; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
       x = min(a, b);          ==&gt;  x = ((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b));
       y = min(1, 2);          ==&gt;  y = ((1) &lt; (2) ? (1) : (2));
       z = min(a + 28, *p);    ==&gt;  z = ((a + 28) &lt; (*p) ? (a + 28) : (*p));
     </pre>

<p>(In this small example you can already see several of the dangers of
macro arguments.  See <a href="#Macro%20Pitfalls">Macro Pitfalls</a>, for detailed explanations.)

   <p>Leading and trailing whitespace in each argument is dropped, and all
whitespace between the tokens of an argument is reduced to a single
space.  Parentheses within each argument must balance; a comma within
such parentheses does not end the argument.  However, there is no
requirement for square brackets or braces to balance, and they do not
prevent a comma from separating arguments.  Thus,

<pre class="example">     macro (array[x = y, x + 1])
     </pre>

<p>passes two arguments to <code>macro</code>: <code>array[x = y</code> and <code>x +
1]</code>.  If you want to supply <code>array[x = y, x + 1]</code> as an argument,
you can write it as <code>array[(x = y, x + 1)]</code>, which is equivalent C
code.

   <p>All arguments to a macro are completely macro-expanded before they are
substituted into the macro body.  After substitution, the complete text
is scanned again for macros to expand, including the arguments.  This rule
may seem strange, but it is carefully designed so you need not worry
about whether any function call is actually a macro invocation.  You can
run into trouble if you try to be too clever, though.  See <a href="#Argument%20Prescan">Argument Prescan</a>, for detailed discussion.

   <p>For example, <code>min (min (a, b), c)</code> is first expanded to

<pre class="example">       min (((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b)), (c))
     </pre>

<p>and then to

<pre class="example">     ((((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b))) &lt; (c)
      ? (((a) &lt; (b) ? (a) : (b)))
      : (c))
     </pre>

<p>(Line breaks shown here for clarity would not actually be generated.)

   <p>You can leave macro arguments empty; this is not an error to the
preprocessor (but many macros will then expand to invalid code). 
You cannot leave out arguments entirely; if a macro takes two arguments,
there must be exactly one comma at the top level of its argument list. 
Here are some silly examples using <code>min</code>:

<pre class="example">     min(, b)        ==&gt; ((   ) &lt; (b) ? (   ) : (b))
     min(a, )        ==&gt; ((a  ) &lt; ( ) ? (a  ) : ( ))
     min(,)          ==&gt; ((   ) &lt; ( ) ? (   ) : ( ))
     min((,),)       ==&gt; (((,)) &lt; ( ) ? ((,)) : ( ))
     
     min()      error--&gt; macro "min" requires 2 arguments, but only 1 given
     min(,,)    error--&gt; macro "min" passed 3 arguments, but takes just 2
     </pre>

   <p>Whitespace is not a preprocessing token, so if a macro <code>foo</code> takes
one argument, <code>foo&nbsp;()</code> and <code>foo&nbsp;(&nbsp;)</code> both supply it an
empty argument.  Previous GNU preprocessor implementations and
documentation were incorrect on this point, insisting that a
function-like macro that takes a single argument be passed a space if an
empty argument was required.

   <p>Macro parameters appearing inside string literals are not replaced by
their corresponding actual arguments.

<pre class="example">     #define foo(x) x, "x"
     foo(bar)        ==&gt; bar, "x"
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Stringification</h4>

<p>Sometimes you may want to convert a macro argument into a string
constant.  Parameters are not replaced inside string constants, but you
can use the <code>#</code> preprocessing operator instead.  When a macro
parameter is used with a leading <code>#</code>, the preprocessor replaces it
with the literal text of the actual argument, converted to a string
constant.  Unlike normal parameter replacement, the argument is not
macro-expanded first.  This is called <dfn>stringification</dfn>.

   <p>There is no way to combine an argument with surrounding text and
stringify it all together.  Instead, you can write a series of adjacent
string constants and stringified arguments.  The preprocessor will
replace the stringified arguments with string constants.  The C
compiler will then combine all the adjacent string constants into one
long string.

   <p>Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringification:

<pre class="example">     #define WARN_IF(EXP) \
     do { if (EXP) \
             fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " #EXP "\n"); } \
     while (0)
     WARN_IF (x == 0);
          ==&gt; do { if (x == 0)
                fprintf (stderr, "Warning: " "x == 0" "\n"); } while (0);
     </pre>

<p>The argument for <code>EXP</code> is substituted once, as-is, into the
<code>if</code> statement, and once, stringified, into the argument to
<code>fprintf</code>.  If <code>x</code> were a macro, it would be expanded in the
<code>if</code> statement, but not in the string.

   <p>The <code>do</code> and <code>while (0)</code> are a kludge to make it possible to
write <code>WARN_IF (</code><var>arg</var><code>);</code>, which the resemblance of
<code>WARN_IF</code> to a function would make C programmers want to do; see
<a href="#Swallowing%20the%20Semicolon">Swallowing the Semicolon</a>.

   <p>Stringification in C involves more than putting double-quote characters
around the fragment.  The preprocessor backslash-escapes the quotes
surrounding embedded string constants, and all backslashes within string and
character constants, in order to get a valid C string constant with the
proper contents.  Thus, stringifying <code>p&nbsp;=&nbsp;"foo\n";</code> results in
<tt>"p&nbsp;=&nbsp;\"foo\\n\";"</tt>.  However, backslashes that are not inside string
or character constants are not duplicated: <code>\n</code> by itself
stringifies to <tt>"\n"</tt>.

   <p>All leading and trailing whitespace in text being stringified is
ignored.  Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text is
converted to a single space in the stringified result.  Comments are
replaced by whitespace long before stringification happens, so they
never appear in stringified text.

   <p>There is no way to convert a macro argument into a character constant.

   <p>If you want to stringify the result of expansion of a macro argument,
you have to use two levels of macros.

<pre class="example">     #define xstr(s) str(s)
     #define str(s) #s
     #define foo 4
     str (foo)
          ==&gt; "foo"
     xstr (foo)
          ==&gt; xstr (4)
          ==&gt; str (4)
          ==&gt; "4"
     </pre>

   <p><code>s</code> is stringified when it is used in <code>str</code>, so it is not
macro-expanded first.  But <code>s</code> is an ordinary argument to
<code>xstr</code>, so it is completely macro-expanded before <code>xstr</code>
itself is expanded (see <a href="#Argument%20Prescan">Argument Prescan</a>).  Therefore, by the time
<code>str</code> gets to its argument, it has already been macro-expanded.

<h3 class="subsection">Concatenation</h4>

<p>It is often useful to merge two tokens into one while expanding macros. 
This is called <dfn>token pasting</dfn> or <dfn>token concatenation</dfn>.  The
<code>##</code> preprocessing operator performs token pasting.  When a macro
is expanded, the two tokens on either side of each <code>##</code> operator
are combined into a single token, which then replaces the <code>##</code> and
the two original tokens in the macro expansion.  Usually both will be
identifiers, or one will be an identifier and the other a preprocessing
number.  When pasted, they make a longer identifier.  This isn't the
only valid case.  It is also possible to concatenate two numbers (or a
number and a name, such as <code>1.5</code> and <code>e3</code>) into a number. 
Also, multi-character operators such as <code>+=</code> can be formed by
token pasting.

   <p>However, two tokens that don't together form a valid token cannot be
pasted together.  For example, you cannot concatenate <code>x</code> with
<code>+</code> in either order.  If you try, the preprocessor issues a warning
and emits the two tokens.  Whether it puts white space between the
tokens is undefined.  It is common to find unnecessary uses of <code>##</code>
in complex macros.  If you get this warning, it is likely that you can
simply remove the <code>##</code>.

   <p>Both the tokens combined by <code>##</code> could come from the macro body,
but you could just as well write them as one token in the first place. 
Token pasting is most useful when one or both of the tokens comes from a
macro argument.  If either of the tokens next to an <code>##</code> is a
parameter name, it is replaced by its actual argument before <code>##</code>
executes.  As with stringification, the actual argument is not
macro-expanded first.  If the argument is empty, that <code>##</code> has no
effect.

   <p>Keep in mind that the C preprocessor converts comments to whitespace
before macros are even considered.  Therefore, you cannot create a
comment by concatenating <code>/</code> and <code>*</code>.  You can put as much
whitespace between <code>##</code> and its operands as you like, including
comments, and you can put comments in arguments that will be
concatenated.  However, it is an error if <code>##</code> appears at either
end of a macro body.

   <p>Consider a C program that interprets named commands.  There probably
needs to be a table of commands, perhaps an array of structures declared
as follows:

<pre class="example">     struct command
     {
       char *name;
       void (*function) (void);
     };
     
     struct command commands[] =
     {
       { "quit", quit_command },
       { "help", help_command },
       ...
     };
     </pre>

   <p>It would be cleaner not to have to give each command name twice, once in
the string constant and once in the function name.  A macro which takes the
name of a command as an argument can make this unnecessary.  The string
constant can be created with stringification, and the function name by
concatenating the argument with <code>_command</code>.  Here is how it is done:

<pre class="example">     #define COMMAND(NAME)  { #NAME, NAME ## _command }
     
     struct command commands[] =
     {
       COMMAND (quit),
       COMMAND (help),
       ...
     };
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Variadic Macros</h4>

<p>A macro can be declared to accept a variable number of arguments much as
a function can.  The syntax for defining the macro is similar to that of
a function.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     #define eprintf(...) fprintf (stderr, __VA_ARGS__)
     </pre>

   <p>This kind of macro is called <dfn>variadic</dfn>.  When the macro is invoked,
all the tokens in its argument list after the last named argument (this
macro has none), including any commas, become the <dfn>variable
argument</dfn>.  This sequence of tokens replaces the identifier
<code>__VA_ARGS__</code> in the macro body wherever it appears.  Thus, we
have this expansion:

<pre class="example">     eprintf ("%s:%d: ", input_file, lineno)
          ==&gt;  fprintf (stderr, "%s:%d: ", input_file, lineno)
     </pre>

   <p>The variable argument is completely macro-expanded before it is inserted
into the macro expansion, just like an ordinary argument.  You may use
the <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> operators to stringify the variable argument
or to paste its leading or trailing token with another token.  (But see
below for an important special case for <code>##</code>.)

   <p>If your macro is complicated, you may want a more descriptive name for
the variable argument than <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>.  CPP permits
this, as an extension.  You may write an argument name immediately
before the <code>...</code>; that name is used for the variable argument. 
The <code>eprintf</code> macro above could be written

<pre class="example">     #define eprintf(args...) fprintf (stderr, args)
     </pre>

<p>using this extension.  You cannot use <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> and this
extension in the same macro.

   <p>You can have named arguments as well as variable arguments in a variadic
macro.  We could define <code>eprintf</code> like this, instead:

<pre class="example">     #define eprintf(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)
     </pre>

<p>This formulation looks more descriptive, but unfortunately it is less
flexible: you must now supply at least one argument after the format
string.  In standard C, you cannot omit the comma separating the named
argument from the variable arguments.  Furthermore, if you leave the
variable argument empty, you will get a syntax error, because
there will be an extra comma after the format string.

<pre class="example">     eprintf("success!\n", );
          ==&gt; fprintf(stderr, "success!\n", );
     </pre>

   <p>GNU CPP has a pair of extensions which deal with this problem.  First,
you are allowed to leave the variable argument out entirely:

<pre class="example">     eprintf ("success!\n")
          ==&gt; fprintf(stderr, "success!\n", );
     </pre>

<p>Second, the <code>##</code> token paste operator has a special meaning when
placed between a comma and a variable argument.  If you write

<pre class="example">     #define eprintf(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ##__VA_ARGS__)
     </pre>

<p>and the variable argument is left out when the <code>eprintf</code> macro is
used, then the comma before the <code>##</code> will be deleted.  This does
<em>not</em> happen if you pass an empty argument, nor does it happen if
the token preceding <code>##</code> is anything other than a comma.

<pre class="example">     eprintf ("success!\n")
          ==&gt; fprintf(stderr, "success!\n");
     </pre>

<p>The above explanation is ambiguous about the case where the only macro
parameter is a variable arguments parameter, as it is meaningless to
try to distinguish whether no argument at all is an empty argument or
a missing argument.  In this case the C99 standard is clear that the
comma must remain, however the existing GCC extension used to swallow
the comma.  So CPP retains the comma when conforming to a specific C
standard, and drops it otherwise.

   <p>C99 mandates that the only place the identifier <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>
can appear is in the replacement list of a variadic macro.  It may not
be used as a macro name, macro argument name, or within a different type
of macro.  It may also be forbidden in open text; the standard is
ambiguous.  We recommend you avoid using it except for its defined
purpose.

   <p>Variadic macros are a new feature in C99.  GNU CPP has supported them
for a long time, but only with a named variable argument
(<code>args...</code>, not <code>...</code> and <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>).  If you are
concerned with portability to previous versions of GCC, you should use
only named variable arguments.  On the other hand, if you are concerned
with portability to other conforming implementations of C99, you should
use only <code>__VA_ARGS__</code>.

   <p>Previous versions of CPP implemented the comma-deletion extension
much more generally.  We have restricted it in this release to minimize
the differences from C99.  To get the same effect with both this and
previous versions of GCC, the token preceding the special <code>##</code> must
be a comma, and there must be white space between that comma and
whatever comes immediately before it:

<pre class="example">     #define eprintf(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format , ##args)
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Predefined Macros</h4>

<p>Several object-like macros are predefined; you use them without
supplying their definitions.  They fall into three classes: standard,
common, and system-specific.

   <p>In C++, there is a fourth category, the named operators.  They act like
predefined macros, but you cannot undefine them.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Standard Predefined Macros</h5>

<p>The standard predefined macros are specified by the relevant
language standards, so they are available with all compilers that
implement those standards.  Older compilers may not provide all of
them.  Their names all start with double underscores.

     <dl>
<dt><code>__FILE__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to the name of the current input file, in the form of
a C string constant.  This is the path by which the preprocessor opened
the file, not the short name specified in <code>#include</code> or as the
input file name argument.  For example,
<code>"/usr/local/include/myheader.h"</code> is a possible expansion of this
macro.

     <br><dt><code>__LINE__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to the current input line number, in the form of a
decimal integer constant.  While we call it a predefined macro, it's
a pretty strange macro, since its "definition" changes with each
new line of source code. 
</dl>

   <p><code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code> are useful in generating an error
message to report an inconsistency detected by the program; the message
can state the source line at which the inconsistency was detected.  For
example,

<pre class="example">     fprintf (stderr, "Internal error: "
                      "negative string length "
                      "%d at %s, line %d.",
              length, __FILE__, __LINE__);
     </pre>

   <p>An <code>#include</code> directive changes the expansions of <code>__FILE__</code>
and <code>__LINE__</code> to correspond to the included file.  At the end of
that file, when processing resumes on the input file that contained
the <code>#include</code> directive, the expansions of <code>__FILE__</code> and
<code>__LINE__</code> revert to the values they had before the
<code>#include</code> (but <code>__LINE__</code> is then incremented by one as
processing moves to the line after the <code>#include</code>).

   <p>A <code>#line</code> directive changes <code>__LINE__</code>, and may change
<code>__FILE__</code> as well.  See <a href="#Line%20Control">Line Control</a>.

   <p>C99 introduces <code>__func__</code>, and GCC has provided <code>__FUNCTION__</code>
for a long time.  Both of these are strings containing the name of the
current function (there are slight semantic differences; see the GCC
manual).  Neither of them is a macro; the preprocessor does not know the
name of the current function.  They tend to be useful in conjunction
with <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code>, though.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>__DATE__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a string constant that describes the date on which
the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains eleven
characters and looks like <code>"Feb&nbsp;12&nbsp;1996"</code>.  If the day of the
month is less than 10, it is padded with a space on the left.

     <p>If GCC cannot determine the current date, it will emit a warning message
(once per compilation) and <code>__DATE__</code> will expand to
<code>"???&nbsp;??&nbsp;????"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__TIME__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a string constant that describes the time at
which the preprocessor is being run.  The string constant contains
eight characters and looks like <code>"23:59:01"</code>.

     <p>If GCC cannot determine the current time, it will emit a warning message
(once per compilation) and <code>__TIME__</code> will expand to
<code>"??:??:??"</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__STDC__</code>
     <dd>In normal operation, this macro expands to the constant 1, to signify
that this compiler conforms to ISO Standard C.  If GNU CPP is used with
a compiler other than GCC, this is not necessarily true; however, the
preprocessor always conforms to the standard unless the
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> option is used.

     <p>This macro is not defined if the <code>-traditional-cpp</code> option is used.

     <p>On some hosts, the system compiler uses a different convention, where
<code>__STDC__</code> is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
conformance to the C Standard.  CPP follows the host convention when
processing system header files, but when processing user files
<code>__STDC__</code> is always 1.  This has been reported to cause problems;
for instance, some versions of Solaris provide X Windows headers that
expect <code>__STDC__</code> to be either undefined or 1.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.

     <br><dt><code>__STDC_VERSION__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to the C Standard's version number, a long integer
constant of the form <code></code><var>yyyy</var><code></code><var>mm</var><code>L</code> where <var>yyyy</var> and
<var>mm</var> are the year and month of the Standard version.  This signifies
which version of the C Standard the compiler conforms to.  Like
<code>__STDC__</code>, this is not necessarily accurate for the entire
implementation, unless GNU CPP is being used with GCC.

     <p>The value <code>199409L</code> signifies the 1989 C standard as amended in
1994, which is the current default; the value <code>199901L</code> signifies
the 1999 revision of the C standard.  Support for the 1999 revision is
not yet complete.

     <p>This macro is not defined if the <code>-traditional-cpp</code> option is
used, nor when compiling C++ or Objective-C.

     <br><dt><code>__STDC_HOSTED__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, if the compiler's target is a
<dfn>hosted environment</dfn>.  A hosted environment has the complete
facilities of the standard C library available.

     <br><dt><code>__cplusplus</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined when the C++ compiler is in use.  You can use
<code>__cplusplus</code> to test whether a header is compiled by a C compiler
or a C++ compiler.  This macro is similar to <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code>, in
that it expands to a version number.  A fully conforming implementation
of the 1998 C++ standard will define this macro to <code>199711L</code>.  The
GNU C++ compiler is not yet fully conforming, so it uses <code>1</code>
instead.  We hope to complete our implementation in the near future.

     <br><dt><code>__OBJC__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, when the Objective-C compiler is in
use.  You can use <code>__OBJC__</code> to test whether a header is compiled
by a C compiler or a Objective-C compiler.

     <br><dt><code>__ASSEMBLER__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined with value 1 when preprocessing assembly
language.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Common Predefined Macros</h5>

<p>The common predefined macros are GNU C extensions.  They are available
with the same meanings regardless of the machine or operating system on
which you are using GNU C.  Their names all start with double
underscores.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>__GNUC__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__GNUC_MINOR__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code>
     <dd>These macros are defined by all GNU compilers that use the C
preprocessor: C, C++, and Objective-C.  Their values are the major
version, minor version, and patch level of the compiler, as integer
constants.  For example, GCC 3.2.1 will define <code>__GNUC__</code> to 3,
<code>__GNUC_MINOR__</code> to 2, and <code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> to 1.  They
are defined only when the entire compiler is in use; if you invoke the
preprocessor directly, they are not defined.

     <p><code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> is new to GCC 3.0; it is also present in the
widely-used development snapshots leading up to 3.0 (which identify
themselves as GCC 2.96 or 2.97, depending on which snapshot you have).

     <p>If all you need to know is whether or not your program is being compiled
by GCC, you can simply test <code>__GNUC__</code>.  If you need to write code
which depends on a specific version, you must be more careful.  Each
time the minor version is increased, the patch level is reset to zero;
each time the major version is increased (which happens rarely), the
minor version and patch level are reset.  If you wish to use the
predefined macros directly in the conditional, you will need to write it
like this:

     <pre class="example">          /* Test for GCC &gt; 3.2.0 */
          #if __GNUC__ &gt; 3 || \
              (__GNUC__ == 3 &amp;&amp; (__GNUC_MINOR__ &gt; 2 || \
                                 (__GNUC_MINOR__ == 2 &amp;&amp; \
                                  __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ &gt; 0))
          </pre>

     <p>Another approach is to use the predefined macros to
calculate a single number, then compare that against a threshold:

     <pre class="example">          #define GCC_VERSION (__GNUC__ * 10000 \
                               + __GNUC_MINOR__ * 100 \
                               + __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__)
          ...
          /* Test for GCC &gt; 3.2.0 */
          #if GCC_VERSION &gt; 30200
          </pre>

     <p>Many people find this form easier to understand.

     <br><dt><code>__GNUG__</code>
     <dd>The GNU C++ compiler defines this.  Testing it is equivalent to
testing <code>(__GNUC__&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;__cplusplus)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code>
     <dd>GCC defines this macro if and only if the <code>-ansi</code> switch, or a
<code>-std</code> switch specifying strict conformance to some version of ISO C,
was specified when GCC was invoked.  It is defined to <code>1</code>. 
This macro exists primarily to direct GNU libc's header files to
restrict their definitions to the minimal set found in the 1989 C
standard.

     <br><dt><code>__BASE_FILE__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to the name of the main input file, in the form
of a C string constant.  This is the source file that was specified
on the command line of the preprocessor or C compiler.

     <br><dt><code>__INCLUDE_LEVEL__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a decimal integer constant that represents the
depth of nesting in include files.  The value of this macro is
incremented on every <code>#include</code> directive and decremented at the
end of every included file.  It starts out at 0, it's value within the
base file specified on the command line.

     <br><dt><code>__ELF__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined if the target uses the ELF object format.

     <br><dt><code>__VERSION__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a string constant which describes the version of
the compiler in use.  You should not rely on its contents having any
particular form, but it can be counted on to contain at least the
release number.

     <br><dt><code>__OPTIMIZE__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__NO_INLINE__</code>
     <dd>These macros describe the compilation mode.  <code>__OPTIMIZE__</code> is
defined in all optimizing compilations.  <code>__OPTIMIZE_SIZE__</code> is
defined if the compiler is optimizing for size, not speed. 
<code>__NO_INLINE__</code> is defined if no functions will be inlined into
their callers (when not optimizing, or when inlining has been
specifically disabled by <code>-fno-inline</code>).

     <p>These macros cause certain GNU header files to provide optimized
definitions, using macros or inline functions, of system library
functions.  You should not use these macros in any way unless you make
sure that programs will execute with the same effect whether or not they
are defined.  If they are defined, their value is 1.

     <br><dt><code>__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</code>
     <dd>GCC defines this macro if and only if the data type <code>char</code> is
unsigned on the target machine.  It exists to cause the standard header
file <code>limits.h</code> to work correctly.  You should not use this macro
yourself; instead, refer to the standard macros defined in <code>limits.h</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__WCHAR_UNSIGNED__</code>
     <dd>Like <code>__CHAR_UNSIGNED__</code>, this macro is defined if and only if the
data type <code>wchar_t</code> is unsigned and the front-end is in C++ mode.

     <br><dt><code>__REGISTER_PREFIX__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a single token (not a string constant) which is
the prefix applied to CPU register names in assembly language for this
target.  You can use it to write assembly that is usable in multiple
environments.  For example, in the <code>m68k-aout</code> environment it
expands to nothing, but in the <code>m68k-coff</code> environment it expands
to a single <code>%</code>.

     <br><dt><code>__USER_LABEL_PREFIX__</code>
     <dd>This macro expands to a single token which is the prefix applied to
user labels (symbols visible to C code) in assembly.  For example, in
the <code>m68k-aout</code> environment it expands to an <code>_</code>, but in the
<code>m68k-coff</code> environment it expands to nothing.

     <p>This macro will have the correct definition even if
<code>-f(no-)underscores</code> is in use, but it will not be correct if
target-specific options that adjust this prefix are used (e.g. the
OSF/rose <code>-mno-underscores</code> option).

     <br><dt><code>__SIZE_TYPE__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__WCHAR_TYPE__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__WINT_TYPE__</code>
     <dd>These macros are defined to the correct underlying types for the
<code>size_t</code>, <code>ptrdiff_t</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>, and <code>wint_t</code>
typedefs, respectively.  They exist to make the standard header files
<code>stddef.h</code> and <code>wchar.h</code> work correctly.  You should not use
these macros directly; instead, include the appropriate headers and use
the typedefs.

     <br><dt><code>__CHAR_BIT__</code>
     <dd>Defined to the number of bits used in the representation of the
<code>char</code> data type.  It exists to make the standard header given
numerical limits work correctly.  You should not use
this macro directly; instead, include the appropriate headers.

     <br><dt><code>__SCHAR_MAX__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__WCHAR_MAX__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__SHRT_MAX__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__INT_MAX__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__LONG_MAX__</code>
     <dd><dt><code>__LONG_LONG_MAX__</code>
     <dd>Defined to the maximum value of the <code>signed char</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>,
<code>signed short</code>,
<code>signed int</code>, <code>signed long</code>, and <code>signed long long</code> types
respectively.  They exist to make the standard header given numerical limits
work correctly.  You should not use these macros directly; instead, include
the appropriate headers.

     <br><dt><code>__USING_SJLJ_EXCEPTIONS__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, if the compiler uses the old
mechanism based on <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> for exception
handling.

     <br><dt><code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code>
     <dd>This macro is defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the NeXT runtime
(as in <code>-fnext-runtime</code>) is in use for Objective-C.  If the GNU
runtime is used, this macro is not defined, so that you can use this
macro to determine which runtime (NeXT or GNU) is being used.

     <br><dt><code>__LP64__</code>
     <dd><br><dt><code>_LP64</code>
     <dd>These macros are defined, with value 1, if (and only if) the compilation
is for a target where <code>long int</code> and pointer both use 64-bits and
<code>int</code> uses 32-bit.

<h3 class="subsubsection">System-specific Predefined Macros</h5>

<p>The C preprocessor normally predefines several macros that indicate what
type of system and machine is in use.  They are obviously different on
each target supported by GCC.  This manual, being for all systems and
machines, cannot tell you what their names are, but you can use
<code>cpp -dM</code> to see them all.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.  All system-specific
predefined macros expand to the constant 1, so you can test them with
either <code>#ifdef</code> or <code>#if</code>.

   <p>The C standard requires that all system-specific macros be part of the
<dfn>reserved namespace</dfn>.  All names which begin with two underscores,
or an underscore and a capital letter, are reserved for the compiler and
library to use as they wish.  However, historically system-specific
macros have had names with no special prefix; for instance, it is common
to find <code>unix</code> defined on Unix systems.  For all such macros, GCC
provides a parallel macro with two underscores added at the beginning
and the end.  If <code>unix</code> is defined, <code>__unix__</code> will be defined
too.  There will never be more than two underscores; the parallel of
<code>_mips</code> is <code>__mips__</code>.

   <p>When the <code>-ansi</code> option, or any <code>-std</code> option that
requests strict conformance, is given to the compiler, all the
system-specific predefined macros outside the reserved namespace are
suppressed.  The parallel macros, inside the reserved namespace, remain
defined.

   <p>We are slowly phasing out all predefined macros which are outside the
reserved namespace.  You should never use them in new programs, and we
encourage you to correct older code to use the parallel macros whenever
you find it.  We don't recommend you use the system-specific macros that
are in the reserved namespace, either.  It is better in the long run to
check specifically for features you need, using a tool such as
<code>autoconf</code>.

<h3 class="subsubsection">C++ Named Operators</h5>

<p>In C++, there are eleven keywords which are simply alternate spellings
of operators normally written with punctuation.  These keywords are
treated as such even in the preprocessor.  They function as operators in
<code>#if</code>, and they cannot be defined as macros or poisoned.  In C, you
can request that those keywords take their C++ meaning by including
<code>iso646.h</code>.  That header defines each one as a normal object-like
macro expanding to the appropriate punctuator.

   <p>These are the named operators and their corresponding punctuators:

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Undefining and Redefining Macros</h4>

<p>If a macro ceases to be useful, it may be <dfn>undefined</dfn> with the
<code>#undef</code> directive.  <code>#undef</code> takes a single argument, the
name of the macro to undefine.  You use the bare macro name, even if the
macro is function-like.  It is an error if anything appears on the line
after the macro name.  <code>#undef</code> has no effect if the name is not a
macro.

<pre class="example">     #define FOO 4
     x = FOO;        ==&gt; x = 4;
     #undef FOO
     x = FOO;        ==&gt; x = FOO;
     </pre>

   <p>Once a macro has been undefined, that identifier may be <dfn>redefined</dfn>
as a macro by a subsequent <code>#define</code> directive.  The new definition
need not have any resemblance to the old definition.

   <p>However, if an identifier which is currently a macro is redefined, then
the new definition must be <dfn>effectively the same</dfn> as the old one. 
Two macro definitions are effectively the same if:
     <ul>
<li>Both are the same type of macro (object- or function-like). 
<li>All the tokens of the replacement list are the same. 
<li>If there are any parameters, they are the same. 
<li>Whitespace appears in the same places in both.  It need not be
exactly the same amount of whitespace, though.  Remember that comments
count as whitespace. 
</ul>

<p>These definitions are effectively the same:
<pre class="example">     #define FOUR (2 + 2)
     #define FOUR         (2    +    2)
     #define FOUR (2 /* two */ + 2)
     </pre>

<p>but these are not:
<pre class="example">     #define FOUR (2 + 2)
     #define FOUR ( 2+2 )
     #define FOUR (2 * 2)
     #define FOUR(score,and,seven,years,ago) (2 + 2)
     </pre>

   <p>If a macro is redefined with a definition that is not effectively the
same as the old one, the preprocessor issues a warning and changes the
macro to use the new definition.  If the new definition is effectively
the same, the redefinition is silently ignored.  This allows, for
instance, two different headers to define a common macro.  The
preprocessor will only complain if the definitions do not match.

<h3 class="subsection">Directives Within Macro Arguments</h4>

<p>Occasionally it is convenient to use preprocessor directives within
the arguments of a macro.  The C and C++ standards declare that
behavior in these cases is undefined.

   <p>Versions of CPP prior to 3.2 would reject such constructs with an
error message.  This was the only syntactic difference between normal
functions and function-like macros, so it seemed attractive to remove
this limitation, and people would often be surprised that they could
not use macros in this way.  Moreover, sometimes people would use
conditional compilation in the argument list to a normal library
function like <code>printf</code>, only to find that after a library upgrade
<code>printf</code> had changed to be a function-like macro, and their code
would no longer compile.  So from version 3.2 we changed CPP to
successfully process arbitrary directives within macro arguments in
exactly the same way as it would have processed the directive were the
function-like macro invocation not present.

   <p>If, within a macro invocation, that macro is redefined, then the new
definition takes effect in time for argument pre-expansion, but the
original definition is still used for argument replacement.  Here is a
pathological example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define f(x) x x
     f (1
     #undef f
     #define f 2
     f)
     </pre>

<p>which expands to

<pre class="smallexample">     1 2 1 2
     </pre>

<p>with the semantics described above.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Misnesting</h5>

<p>When a macro is called with arguments, the arguments are substituted
into the macro body and the result is checked, together with the rest of
the input file, for more macro calls.  It is possible to piece together
a macro call coming partially from the macro body and partially from the
arguments.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define twice(x) (2*(x))
     #define call_with_1(x) x(1)
     call_with_1 (twice)
          ==&gt; twice(1)
          ==&gt; (2*(1))
     </pre>

   <p>Macro definitions do not have to have balanced parentheses.  By writing
an unbalanced open parenthesis in a macro body, it is possible to create
a macro call that begins inside the macro body but ends outside of it. 
For example,

<pre class="example">     #define strange(file) fprintf (file, "%s %d",
     ...
     strange(stderr) p, 35)
          ==&gt; fprintf (stderr, "%s %d", p, 35)
     </pre>

   <p>The ability to piece together a macro call can be useful, but the use of
unbalanced open parentheses in a macro body is just confusing, and
should be avoided.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Operator Precedence Problems</h5>

<p>You may have noticed that in most of the macro definition examples shown
above, each occurrence of a macro argument name had parentheses around
it.  In addition, another pair of parentheses usually surround the
entire macro definition.  Here is why it is best to write macros that
way.

   <p>Suppose you define a macro as follows,

<pre class="example">     #define ceil_div(x, y) (x + y - 1) / y
     </pre>

<p>whose purpose is to divide, rounding up.  (One use for this operation is
to compute how many <code>int</code> objects are needed to hold a certain
number of <code>char</code> objects.)  Then suppose it is used as follows:

<pre class="example">     a = ceil_div (b &amp; c, sizeof (int));
          ==&gt; a = (b &amp; c + sizeof (int) - 1) / sizeof (int);
     </pre>

<p>This does not do what is intended.  The operator-precedence rules of
C make it equivalent to this:

<pre class="example">     a = (b &amp; (c + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
     </pre>

<p>What we want is this:

<pre class="example">     a = ((b &amp; c) + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
     </pre>

<p>Defining the macro as

<pre class="example">     #define ceil_div(x, y) ((x) + (y) - 1) / (y)
     </pre>

<p>provides the desired result.

   <p>Unintended grouping can result in another way.  Consider <code>sizeof
ceil_div(1, 2)</code>.  That has the appearance of a C expression that would
compute the size of the type of <code>ceil_div (1, 2)</code>, but in fact it
means something very different.  Here is what it expands to:

<pre class="example">     sizeof ((1) + (2) - 1) / (2)
     </pre>

<p>This would take the size of an integer and divide it by two.  The
precedence rules have put the division outside the <code>sizeof</code> when it
was intended to be inside.

   <p>Parentheses around the entire macro definition prevent such problems. 
Here, then, is the recommended way to define <code>ceil_div</code>:

<pre class="example">     #define ceil_div(x, y) (((x) + (y) - 1) / (y))
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Swallowing the Semicolon</h5>

<p>Often it is desirable to define a macro that expands into a compound
statement.  Consider, for example, the following macro, that advances a
pointer (the argument <code>p</code> says where to find it) across whitespace
characters:

<pre class="example">     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)  \
     { char *lim = (limit);         \
       while (p &lt; lim) {            \
         if (*p++ != ' ') {         \
           p--; break; }}}
     </pre>

<p>Here backslash-newline is used to split the macro definition, which must
be a single logical line, so that it resembles the way such code would
be laid out if not part of a macro definition.

   <p>A call to this macro might be <code>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim)</code>.  Strictly
speaking, the call expands to a compound statement, which is a complete
statement with no need for a semicolon to end it.  However, since it
looks like a function call, it minimizes confusion if you can use it
like a function call, writing a semicolon afterward, as in
<code>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);</code>

   <p>This can cause trouble before <code>else</code> statements, because the
semicolon is actually a null statement.  Suppose you write

<pre class="example">     if (*p != 0)
       SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);
     else ...
     </pre>

<p>The presence of two statements--the compound statement and a null
statement--in between the <code>if</code> condition and the <code>else</code>
makes invalid C code.

   <p>The definition of the macro <code>SKIP_SPACES</code> can be altered to solve
this problem, using a <code>do ... while</code> statement.  Here is how:

<pre class="example">     #define SKIP_SPACES(p, limit)     \
     do { char *lim = (limit);         \
          while (p &lt; lim) {            \
            if (*p++ != ' ') {         \
              p--; break; }}}          \
     while (0)
     </pre>

   <p>Now <code>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);</code> expands into

<pre class="example">     do {...} while (0);
     </pre>

<p>which is one statement.  The loop executes exactly once; most compilers
generate no extra code for it.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Duplication of Side Effects</h5>

<p>Many C programs define a macro <code>min</code>, for "minimum", like this:

<pre class="example">     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) &lt; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
     </pre>

   <p>When you use this macro with an argument containing a side effect,
as shown here,

<pre class="example">     next = min (x + y, foo (z));
     </pre>

<p>it expands as follows:

<pre class="example">     next = ((x + y) &lt; (foo (z)) ? (x + y) : (foo (z)));
     </pre>

<p>where <code>x + y</code> has been substituted for <code>X</code> and <code>foo (z)</code>
for <code>Y</code>.

   <p>The function <code>foo</code> is used only once in the statement as it appears
in the program, but the expression <code>foo (z)</code> has been substituted
twice into the macro expansion.  As a result, <code>foo</code> might be called
two times when the statement is executed.  If it has side effects or if
it takes a long time to compute, the results might not be what you
intended.  We say that <code>min</code> is an <dfn>unsafe</dfn> macro.

   <p>The best solution to this problem is to define <code>min</code> in a way that
computes the value of <code>foo (z)</code> only once.  The C language offers
no standard way to do this, but it can be done with GNU extensions as
follows:

<pre class="example">     #define min(X, Y)                \
     ({ typeof (X) x_ = (X);          \
        typeof (Y) y_ = (Y);          \
        (x_ &lt; y_) ? x_ : y_; })
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>({ ... })</code> notation produces a compound statement that
acts as an expression.  Its value is the value of its last statement. 
This permits us to define local variables and assign each argument to
one.  The local variables have underscores after their names to reduce
the risk of conflict with an identifier of wider scope (it is impossible
to avoid this entirely).  Now each argument is evaluated exactly once.

   <p>If you do not wish to use GNU C extensions, the only solution is to be
careful when <em>using</em> the macro <code>min</code>.  For example, you can
calculate the value of <code>foo (z)</code>, save it in a variable, and use
that variable in <code>min</code>:

<pre class="example">     #define min(X, Y)  ((X) &lt; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
     ...
     {
       int tem = foo (z);
       next = min (x + y, tem);
     }
     </pre>

<p>(where we assume that <code>foo</code> returns type <code>int</code>).

<h3 class="subsubsection">Self-Referential Macros</h5>

<p>A <dfn>self-referential</dfn> macro is one whose name appears in its
definition.  Recall that all macro definitions are rescanned for more
macros to replace.  If the self-reference were considered a use of the
macro, it would produce an infinitely large expansion.  To prevent this,
the self-reference is not considered a macro call.  It is passed into
the preprocessor output unchanged.  Let's consider an example:

<pre class="example">     #define foo (4 + foo)
     </pre>

<p>where <code>foo</code> is also a variable in your program.

   <p>Following the ordinary rules, each reference to <code>foo</code> will expand
into <code>(4 + foo)</code>; then this will be rescanned and will expand into
<code>(4 + (4 + foo))</code>; and so on until the computer runs out of memory.

   <p>The self-reference rule cuts this process short after one step, at
<code>(4 + foo)</code>.  Therefore, this macro definition has the possibly
useful effect of causing the program to add 4 to the value of <code>foo</code>
wherever <code>foo</code> is referred to.

   <p>In most cases, it is a bad idea to take advantage of this feature.  A
person reading the program who sees that <code>foo</code> is a variable will
not expect that it is a macro as well.  The reader will come across the
identifier <code>foo</code> in the program and think its value should be that
of the variable <code>foo</code>, whereas in fact the value is four greater.

   <p>One common, useful use of self-reference is to create a macro which
expands to itself.  If you write

<pre class="example">     #define EPERM EPERM
     </pre>

<p>then the macro <code>EPERM</code> expands to <code>EPERM</code>.  Effectively, it is
left alone by the preprocessor whenever it's used in running text.  You
can tell that it's a macro with <code>#ifdef</code>.  You might do this if you
want to define numeric constants with an <code>enum</code>, but have
<code>#ifdef</code> be true for each constant.

   <p>If a macro <code>x</code> expands to use a macro <code>y</code>, and the expansion of
<code>y</code> refers to the macro <code>x</code>, that is an <dfn>indirect
self-reference</dfn> of <code>x</code>.  <code>x</code> is not expanded in this case
either.  Thus, if we have

<pre class="example">     #define x (4 + y)
     #define y (2 * x)
     </pre>

<p>then <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> expand as follows:

<pre class="example">     x    ==&gt; (4 + y)
          ==&gt; (4 + (2 * x))
     
     y    ==&gt; (2 * x)
          ==&gt; (2 * (4 + y))
     </pre>

<p>Each macro is expanded when it appears in the definition of the other
macro, but not when it indirectly appears in its own definition.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Argument Prescan</h5>

<p>Macro arguments are completely macro-expanded before they are
substituted into a macro body, unless they are stringified or pasted
with other tokens.  After substitution, the entire macro body, including
the substituted arguments, is scanned again for macros to be expanded. 
The result is that the arguments are scanned <em>twice</em> to expand
macro calls in them.

   <p>Most of the time, this has no effect.  If the argument contained any
macro calls, they are expanded during the first scan.  The result
therefore contains no macro calls, so the second scan does not change
it.  If the argument were substituted as given, with no prescan, the
single remaining scan would find the same macro calls and produce the
same results.

   <p>You might expect the double scan to change the results when a
self-referential macro is used in an argument of another macro
(see <a href="#Self-Referential%20Macros">Self-Referential Macros</a>): the self-referential macro would be
expanded once in the first scan, and a second time in the second scan. 
However, this is not what happens.  The self-references that do not
expand in the first scan are marked so that they will not expand in the
second scan either.

   <p>You might wonder, "Why mention the prescan, if it makes no difference? 
And why not skip it and make the preprocessor faster?"  The answer is
that the prescan does make a difference in three special cases:

     <ul>
<li>Nested calls to a macro.

     <p>We say that <dfn>nested</dfn> calls to a macro occur when a macro's argument
contains a call to that very macro.  For example, if <code>f</code> is a macro
that expects one argument, <code>f (f (1))</code> is a nested pair of calls to
<code>f</code>.  The desired expansion is made by expanding <code>f (1)</code> and
substituting that into the definition of <code>f</code>.  The prescan causes
the expected result to happen.  Without the prescan, <code>f (1)</code> itself
would be substituted as an argument, and the inner use of <code>f</code> would
appear during the main scan as an indirect self-reference and would not
be expanded.

     </p><li>Macros that call other macros that stringify or concatenate.

     <p>If an argument is stringified or concatenated, the prescan does not
occur.  If you <em>want</em> to expand a macro, then stringify or
concatenate its expansion, you can do that by causing one macro to call
another macro that does the stringification or concatenation.  For
instance, if you have

     <pre class="example">          #define AFTERX(x) X_ ## x
          #define XAFTERX(x) AFTERX(x)
          #define TABLESIZE 1024
          #define BUFSIZE TABLESIZE
          </pre>

     <p>then <code>AFTERX(BUFSIZE)</code> expands to <code>X_BUFSIZE</code>, and
<code>XAFTERX(BUFSIZE)</code> expands to <code>X_1024</code>.  (Not to
<code>X_TABLESIZE</code>.  Prescan always does a complete expansion.)

     </p><li>Macros used in arguments, whose expansions contain unshielded commas.

     <p>This can cause a macro expanded on the second scan to be called with the
wrong number of arguments.  Here is an example:

     <pre class="example">          #define foo  a,b
          #define bar(x) lose(x)
          #define lose(x) (1 + (x))
          </pre>

     <p>We would like <code>bar(foo)</code> to turn into <code>(1 + (foo))</code>, which
would then turn into <code>(1 + (a,b))</code>.  Instead, <code>bar(foo)</code>
expands into <code>lose(a,b)</code>, and you get an error because <code>lose</code>
requires a single argument.  In this case, the problem is easily solved
by the same parentheses that ought to be used to prevent misnesting of
arithmetic operations:

     <pre class="example">          #define foo (a,b)
     <br>or<br>
          #define bar(x) lose((x))
          </pre>

     <p>The extra pair of parentheses prevents the comma in <code>foo</code>'s
definition from being interpreted as an argument separator.

   </ul>

</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Newlines in Arguments</h5>

<p>The invocation of a function-like macro can extend over many logical
lines.  However, in the present implementation, the entire expansion
comes out on one line.  Thus line numbers emitted by the compiler or
debugger refer to the line the invocation started on, which might be
different to the line containing the argument causing the problem.

   <p>Here is an example illustrating this:

<pre class="example">     #define ignore_second_arg(a,b,c) a; c
     
     ignore_second_arg (foo (),
                        ignored (),
                        syntax error);
     </pre>

<p>The syntax error triggered by the tokens <code>syntax error</code> results in
an error message citing line three--the line of ignore_second_arg--
even though the problematic code comes from line five.

   <p>We consider this a bug, and intend to fix it in the near future.

</div>

<h3 class="section">Conditionals</h3>

<p>A <dfn>conditional</dfn> is a directive that instructs the preprocessor to
select whether or not to include a chunk of code in the final token
stream passed to the compiler.  Preprocessor conditionals can test
arithmetic expressions, or whether a name is defined as a macro, or both
simultaneously using the special <code>defined</code> operator.

   <p>A conditional in the C preprocessor resembles in some ways an <code>if</code>
statement in C, but it is important to understand the difference between
them.  The condition in an <code>if</code> statement is tested during the
execution of your program.  Its purpose is to allow your program to
behave differently from run to run, depending on the data it is
operating on.  The condition in a preprocessing conditional directive is
tested when your program is compiled.  Its purpose is to allow different
code to be included in the program depending on the situation at the
time of compilation.

   <p>However, the distinction is becoming less clear.  Modern compilers often
do test <code>if</code> statements when a program is compiled, if their
conditions are known not to vary at run time, and eliminate code which
can never be executed.  If you can count on your compiler to do this,
you may find that your program is more readable if you use <code>if</code>
statements with constant conditions (perhaps determined by macros).  Of
course, you can only use this to exclude code, not type definitions or
other preprocessing directives, and you can only do it if the code
remains syntactically valid when it is not to be used.

   <p>GCC version 3 eliminates this kind of never-executed code even when
not optimizing.  Older versions did it only when optimizing.

<h3 class="subsection">Conditional Uses</h4>

<p>There are three general reasons to use a conditional.

     <ul>
<li>A program may need to use different code depending on the machine or
operating system it is to run on.  In some cases the code for one
operating system may be erroneous on another operating system; for
example, it might refer to data types or constants that do not exist on
the other system.  When this happens, it is not enough to avoid
executing the invalid code.  Its mere presence will cause the compiler
to reject the program.  With a preprocessing conditional, the offending
code can be effectively excised from the program when it is not valid.

     <li>You may want to be able to compile the same source file into two
different programs.  One version might make frequent time-consuming
consistency checks on its intermediate data, or print the values of
those data for debugging, and the other not.

     <li>A conditional whose condition is always false is one way to exclude code
from the program but keep it as a sort of comment for future reference. 
</ul>

   <p>Simple programs that do not need system-specific logic or complex
debugging hooks generally will not need to use preprocessing
conditionals.

<h3 class="subsection">Conditional Syntax</h4>

<p>A conditional in the C preprocessor begins with a <dfn>conditional
directive</dfn>: <code>#if</code>, <code>#ifdef</code> or <code>#ifndef</code>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Ifdef</h5>

<p>The simplest sort of conditional is

<pre class="example">     #ifdef <var>MACRO</var>
     
     <var>controlled text</var>
     
     #endif /* <var>MACRO</var> */
     </pre>

   <p>This block is called a <dfn>conditional group</dfn>.  <var>controlled text</var>
will be included in the output of the preprocessor if and only if
<var>MACRO</var> is defined.  We say that the conditional <dfn>succeeds</dfn> if
<var>MACRO</var> is defined, <dfn>fails</dfn> if it is not.

   <p>The <var>controlled text</var> inside of a conditional can include
preprocessing directives.  They are executed only if the conditional
succeeds.  You can nest conditional groups inside other conditional
groups, but they must be completely nested.  In other words,
<code>#endif</code> always matches the nearest <code>#ifdef</code> (or
<code>#ifndef</code>, or <code>#if</code>).  Also, you cannot start a conditional
group in one file and end it in another.

   <p>Even if a conditional fails, the <var>controlled text</var> inside it is
still run through initial transformations and tokenization.  Therefore,
it must all be lexically valid C.  Normally the only way this matters is
that all comments and string literals inside a failing conditional group
must still be properly ended.

   <p>The comment following the <code>#endif</code> is not required, but it is a
good practice if there is a lot of <var>controlled text</var>, because it
helps people match the <code>#endif</code> to the corresponding <code>#ifdef</code>. 
Older programs sometimes put <var>MACRO</var> directly after the
<code>#endif</code> without enclosing it in a comment.  This is invalid code
according to the C standard.  CPP accepts it with a warning.  It
never affects which <code>#ifndef</code> the <code>#endif</code> matches.

   <p>Sometimes you wish to use some code if a macro is <em>not</em> defined. 
You can do this by writing <code>#ifndef</code> instead of <code>#ifdef</code>. 
One common use of <code>#ifndef</code> is to include code only the first
time a header file is included.  See <a href="#Once-Only%20Headers">Once-Only Headers</a>.

   <p>Macro definitions can vary between compilations for several reasons. 
Here are some samples.

     <ul>
<li>Some macros are predefined on each kind of machine
(see <a href="#System-specific%20Predefined%20Macros">System-specific Predefined Macros</a>).  This allows you to provide
code specially tuned for a particular machine.

     <li>System header files define more macros, associated with the features
they implement.  You can test these macros with conditionals to avoid
using a system feature on a machine where it is not implemented.

     <li>Macros can be defined or undefined with the <code>-D</code> and <code>-U</code>
command line options when you compile the program.  You can arrange to
compile the same source file into two different programs by choosing a
macro name to specify which program you want, writing conditionals to
test whether or how this macro is defined, and then controlling the
state of the macro with command line options, perhaps set in the
Makefile.  See <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.

     <li>Your program might have a special header file (often called
<code>config.h</code>) that is adjusted when the program is compiled.  It can
define or not define macros depending on the features of the system and
the desired capabilities of the program.  The adjustment can be
automated by a tool such as <code>autoconf</code>, or done by hand.

<h3 class="subsubsection">If</h5>

<p>The <code>#if</code> directive allows you to test the value of an arithmetic
expression, rather than the mere existence of one macro.  Its syntax is

<pre class="example">     #if <var>expression</var>
     
     <var>controlled text</var>
     
     #endif /* <var>expression</var> */
     </pre>

   <p><var>expression</var> is a C expression of integer type, subject to stringent
restrictions.  It may contain

     <ul>
<li>Integer constants.

     <li>Character constants, which are interpreted as they would be in normal
code.

     <li>Arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, bitwise operations, shifts, comparisons, and logical
operations (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>).  The latter two obey the usual
short-circuiting rules of standard C.

     <li>Macros.  All macros in the expression are expanded before actual
computation of the expression's value begins.

     <li>Uses of the <code>defined</code> operator, which lets you check whether macros
are defined in the middle of an <code>#if</code>.

     <li>Identifiers that are not macros, which are all considered to be the
number zero.  This allows you to write <code>#if&nbsp;MACRO</code> instead of
<code>#ifdef&nbsp;MACRO</code>, if you know that MACRO, when defined, will
always have a nonzero value.  Function-like macros used without their
function call parentheses are also treated as zero.

     <p>In some contexts this shortcut is undesirable.  The <code>-Wundef</code>
option causes GCC to warn whenever it encounters an identifier which is
not a macro in an <code>#if</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>The preprocessor does not know anything about types in the language. 
Therefore, <code>sizeof</code> operators are not recognized in <code>#if</code>, and
neither are <code>enum</code> constants.  They will be taken as identifiers
which are not macros, and replaced by zero.  In the case of
<code>sizeof</code>, this is likely to cause the expression to be invalid.

   <p>The preprocessor calculates the value of <var>expression</var>.  It carries
out all calculations in the widest integer type known to the compiler;
on most machines supported by GCC this is 64 bits.  This is not the same
rule as the compiler uses to calculate the value of a constant
expression, and may give different results in some cases.  If the value
comes out to be nonzero, the <code>#if</code> succeeds and the <var>controlled
text</var> is included; otherwise it is skipped.

   <p>If <var>expression</var> is not correctly formed, GCC issues an error and
treats the conditional as having failed.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Defined</h5>

<p>The special operator <code>defined</code> is used in <code>#if</code> and
<code>#elif</code> expressions to test whether a certain name is defined as a
macro.  <code>defined </code><var>name</var><code></code> and <code>defined (</code><var>name</var><code>)</code> are
both expressions whose value is 1 if <var>name</var> is defined as a macro at
the current point in the program, and 0 otherwise.  Thus,  <code>#if&nbsp;defined&nbsp;MACRO</code> is precisely equivalent to <code>#ifdef&nbsp;MACRO</code>.

   <p><code>defined</code> is useful when you wish to test more than one macro for
existence at once.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #if defined (__vax__) || defined (__ns16000__)
     </pre>

<p>would succeed if either of the names <code>__vax__</code> or
<code>__ns16000__</code> is defined as a macro.

   <p>Conditionals written like this:

<pre class="example">     #if defined BUFSIZE &amp;&amp; BUFSIZE &gt;= 1024
     </pre>

<p>can generally be simplified to just <code>#if&nbsp;BUFSIZE&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;1024</code>,
since if <code>BUFSIZE</code> is not defined, it will be interpreted as having
the value zero.

   <p>If the <code>defined</code> operator appears as a result of a macro expansion,
the C standard says the behavior is undefined.  GNU cpp treats it as a
genuine <code>defined</code> operator and evaluates it normally.  It will warn
wherever your code uses this feature if you use the command-line option
<code>-pedantic</code>, since other compilers may handle it differently.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Else</h5>

<p>The <code>#else</code> directive can be added to a conditional to provide
alternative text to be used if the condition fails.  This is what it
looks like:

<pre class="example">     #if <var>expression</var>
     <var>text-if-true</var>
     #else /* Not <var>expression</var> */
     <var>text-if-false</var>
     #endif /* Not <var>expression</var> */
     </pre>

<p>If <var>expression</var> is nonzero, the <var>text-if-true</var> is included and
the <var>text-if-false</var> is skipped.  If <var>expression</var> is zero, the
opposite happens.

   <p>You can use <code>#else</code> with <code>#ifdef</code> and <code>#ifndef</code>, too.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Elif</h5>

<p>One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more than two
possible alternatives.  For example, you might have

<pre class="example">     #if X == 1
     ...
     #else /* X != 1 */
     #if X == 2
     ...
     #else /* X != 2 */
     ...
     #endif /* X != 2 */
     #endif /* X != 1 */
     </pre>

   <p>Another conditional directive, <code>#elif</code>, allows this to be
abbreviated as follows:

<pre class="example">     #if X == 1
     ...
     #elif X == 2
     ...
     #else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
     ...
     #endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
     </pre>

   <p><code>#elif</code> stands for "else if".  Like <code>#else</code>, it goes in the
middle of a conditional group and subdivides it; it does not require a
matching <code>#endif</code> of its own.  Like <code>#if</code>, the <code>#elif</code>
directive includes an expression to be tested.  The text following the
<code>#elif</code> is processed only if the original <code>#if</code>-condition
failed and the <code>#elif</code> condition succeeds.

   <p>More than one <code>#elif</code> can go in the same conditional group.  Then
the text after each <code>#elif</code> is processed only if the <code>#elif</code>
condition succeeds after the original <code>#if</code> and all previous
<code>#elif</code> directives within it have failed.

   <p><code>#else</code> is allowed after any number of <code>#elif</code> directives, but
<code>#elif</code> may not follow <code>#else</code>.

<h3 class="subsection">Deleted Code</h4>

<p>If you replace or delete a part of the program but want to keep the old
code around for future reference, you often cannot simply comment it
out.  Block comments do not nest, so the first comment inside the old
code will end the commenting-out.  The probable result is a flood of
syntax errors.

   <p>One way to avoid this problem is to use an always-false conditional
instead.  For instance, put <code>#if 0</code> before the deleted code and
<code>#endif</code> after it.  This works even if the code being turned
off contains conditionals, but they must be entire conditionals
(balanced <code>#if</code> and <code>#endif</code>).

   <p>Some people use <code>#ifdef notdef</code> instead.  This is risky, because
<code>notdef</code> might be accidentally defined as a macro, and then the
conditional would succeed.  <code>#if 0</code> can be counted on to fail.

   <p>Do not use <code>#if 0</code> for comments which are not C code.  Use a real
comment, instead.  The interior of <code>#if 0</code> must consist of complete
tokens; in particular, single-quote characters must balance.  Comments
often contain unbalanced single-quote characters (known in English as
apostrophes).  These confuse <code>#if 0</code>.  They don't confuse
<code>/*</code>.

<h3 class="section">Diagnostics</h3>

<p>The directive <code>#error</code> causes the preprocessor to report a fatal
error.  The tokens forming the rest of the line following <code>#error</code>
are used as the error message.

   <p>You would use <code>#error</code> inside of a conditional that detects a
combination of parameters which you know the program does not properly
support.  For example, if you know that the program will not run
properly on a VAX, you might write

<pre class="example">     #ifdef __vax__
     #error "Won't work on VAXen.  See comments at get_last_object."
     #endif
     </pre>

   <p>If you have several configuration parameters that must be set up by
the installation in a consistent way, you can use conditionals to detect
an inconsistency and report it with <code>#error</code>.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #if !defined(UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP) &amp;&amp; defined(DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO)
     #error "DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO requires UNALIGNED_INT_ASM_OP."
     #endif
     </pre>

   <p>The directive <code>#warning</code> is like <code>#error</code>, but causes the
preprocessor to issue a warning and continue preprocessing.  The tokens
following <code>#warning</code> are used as the warning message.

   <p>You might use <code>#warning</code> in obsolete header files, with a message
directing the user to the header file which should be used instead.

   <p>Neither <code>#error</code> nor <code>#warning</code> macro-expands its argument. 
Internal whitespace sequences are each replaced with a single space. 
The line must consist of complete tokens.  It is wisest to make the
argument of these directives be a single string constant; this avoids
problems with apostrophes and the like.

</div>

<h3 class="section">Line Control</h3>

<p>The C preprocessor informs the C compiler of the location in your source
code where each token came from.  Presently, this is just the file name
and line number.  All the tokens resulting from macro expansion are
reported as having appeared on the line of the source file where the
outermost macro was used.  We intend to be more accurate in the future.

   <p>If you write a program which generates source code, such as the
<code>bison</code> parser generator, you may want to adjust the preprocessor's
notion of the current file name and line number by hand.  Parts of the
output from <code>bison</code> are generated from scratch, other parts come
from a standard parser file.  The rest are copied verbatim from
<code>bison</code>'s input.  You would like compiler error messages and
symbolic debuggers to be able to refer to <code>bison</code>'s input file.

   <p><code>bison</code> or any such program can arrange this by writing
<code>#line</code> directives into the output file.  <code>#line</code> is a
directive that specifies the original line number and source file name
for subsequent input in the current preprocessor input file. 
<code>#line</code> has three variants:

     <dl>
<dt><code>#line </code><var>linenum</var><code></code>
     <dd><var>linenum</var> is a non-negative decimal integer constant.  It specifies
the line number which should be reported for the following line of
input.  Subsequent lines are counted from <var>linenum</var>.

     <br><dt><code>#line </code><var>linenum</var><code> </code><var>filename</var><code></code>
     <dd><var>linenum</var> is the same as for the first form, and has the same
effect.  In addition, <var>filename</var> is a string constant.  The
following line and all subsequent lines are reported to come from the
file it specifies, until something else happens to change that. 
<var>filename</var> is interpreted according to the normal rules for a string
constant: backslash escapes are interpreted.  This is different from
<code>#include</code>.

     <p>Previous versions of CPP did not interpret escapes in <code>#line</code>;
we have changed it because the standard requires they be interpreted,
and most other compilers do.

     <br><dt><code>#line </code><var>anything else</var><code></code>
     <dd><var>anything else</var> is checked for macro calls, which are expanded. 
The result should match one of the above two forms. 
</dl>

   <p><code>#line</code> directives alter the results of the <code>__FILE__</code> and
<code>__LINE__</code> predefined macros from that point on.  See <a href="#Standard%20Predefined%20Macros">Standard Predefined Macros</a>.  They do not have any effect on <code>#include</code>'s
idea of the directory containing the current file.  This is a change
from GCC 2.95.  Previously, a file reading

<pre class="smallexample">     #line 1 "../src/gram.y"
     #include "gram.h"
     </pre>

   <p>would search for <code>gram.h</code> in <code>../src</code>, then the <code>-I</code>
chain; the directory containing the physical source file would not be
searched.  In GCC 3.0 and later, the <code>#include</code> is not affected by
the presence of a <code>#line</code> referring to a different directory.

   <p>We made this change because the old behavior caused problems when
generated source files were transported between machines.  For instance,
it is common practice to ship generated parsers with a source release,
so that people building the distribution do not need to have yacc or
Bison installed.  These files frequently have <code>#line</code> directives
referring to the directory tree of the system where the distribution was
created.  If GCC tries to search for headers in those directories, the
build is likely to fail.

   <p>The new behavior can cause failures too, if the generated file is not
in the same directory as its source and it attempts to include a header
which would be visible searching from the directory containing the
source file.  However, this problem is easily solved with an additional
<code>-I</code> switch on the command line.  The failures caused by the old
semantics could sometimes be corrected only by editing the generated
files, which is difficult and error-prone.

<h3 class="section">Pragmas</h3>

<p>The <code>#pragma</code> directive is the method specified by the C standard
for providing additional information to the compiler, beyond what is
conveyed in the language itself.  Three forms of this directive
(commonly known as <dfn>pragmas</dfn>) are specified by the 1999 C standard. 
A C compiler is free to attach any meaning it likes to other pragmas.

   <p>GCC has historically preferred to use extensions to the syntax of the
language, such as <code>__attribute__</code>, for this purpose.  However, GCC
does define a few pragmas of its own.  These mostly have effects on the
entire translation unit or source file.

   <p>In GCC version 3, all GNU-defined, supported pragmas have been given a
<code>GCC</code> prefix.  This is in line with the <code>STDC</code> prefix on all
pragmas defined by C99.  For backward compatibility, pragmas which were
recognized by previous versions are still recognized without the
<code>GCC</code> prefix, but that usage is deprecated.  Some older pragmas are
deprecated in their entirety.  They are not recognized with the
<code>GCC</code> prefix.  See <a href="#Obsolete%20Features">Obsolete Features</a>.

   <p>C99 introduces the <code>_Pragma</code> operator.  This feature addresses a
major problem with <code>#pragma</code>: being a directive, it cannot be
produced as the result of macro expansion.  <code>_Pragma</code> is an
operator, much like <code>sizeof</code> or <code>defined</code>, and can be embedded
in a macro.

   <p>Its syntax is <code>_Pragma&nbsp;(</code><var>string-literal</var><code>)</code>, where
<var>string-literal</var> can be either a normal or wide-character string
literal.  It is destringized, by replacing all <code>\\</code> with a single
<code>\</code> and all <code>\"</code> with a <code>"</code>.  The result is then
processed as if it had appeared as the right hand side of a
<code>#pragma</code> directive.  For example,

<pre class="example">     _Pragma ("GCC dependency \"parse.y\"")
     </pre>

<p>has the same effect as <code>#pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"</code>.  The
same effect could be achieved using macros, for example

<pre class="example">     #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
     DO_PRAGMA (GCC dependency "parse.y")
     </pre>

   <p>The standard is unclear on where a <code>_Pragma</code> operator can appear. 
The preprocessor does not accept it within a preprocessing conditional
directive like <code>#if</code>.  To be safe, you are probably best keeping it
out of directives other than <code>#define</code>, and putting it on a line of
its own.

   <p>This manual documents the pragmas which are meaningful to the
preprocessor itself.  Other pragmas are meaningful to the C or C++
compilers.  They are documented in the GCC manual.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma GCC dependency</code>
     <dd><code>#pragma GCC dependency</code> allows you to check the relative dates of
the current file and another file.  If the other file is more recent than
the current file, a warning is issued.  This is useful if the current
file is derived from the other file, and should be regenerated.  The
other file is searched for using the normal include search path. 
Optional trailing text can be used to give more information in the
warning message.

     <pre class="example">          #pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"
          #pragma GCC dependency "/usr/include/time.h" rerun fixincludes
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>#pragma GCC poison</code>
     <dd>Sometimes, there is an identifier that you want to remove completely
from your program, and make sure that it never creeps back in.  To
enforce this, you can <dfn>poison</dfn> the identifier with this pragma. 
<code>#pragma GCC poison</code> is followed by a list of identifiers to
poison.  If any of those identifiers appears anywhere in the source
after the directive, it is a hard error.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          #pragma GCC poison printf sprintf fprintf
          sprintf(some_string, "hello");
          </pre>

     <p>will produce an error.

     <p>If a poisoned identifier appears as part of the expansion of a macro
which was defined before the identifier was poisoned, it will <em>not</em>
cause an error.  This lets you poison an identifier without worrying
about system headers defining macros that use it.

     <p>For example,

     <pre class="example">          #define strrchr rindex
          #pragma GCC poison rindex
          strrchr(some_string, 'h');
          </pre>

     <p>will not produce an error.

     <br><dt><code>#pragma GCC system_header</code>
     <dd>This pragma takes no arguments.  It causes the rest of the code in the
current file to be treated as if it came from a system header. 
See <a href="#System%20Headers">System Headers</a>.

<h3 class="section">Other Directives</h3>

<p>The <code>#ident</code> directive takes one argument, a string constant.  On
some systems, that string constant is copied into a special segment of
the object file.  On other systems, the directive is ignored.

   <p>This directive is not part of the C standard, but it is not an official
GNU extension either.  We believe it came from System V.

   <p>The <code>#sccs</code> directive is recognized, because it appears in the
header files of some systems.  It is a very old, obscure, extension
which we did not invent, and we have been unable to find any
documentation of what it should do, so GCC simply ignores it.

   <p>The <dfn>null directive</dfn> consists of a <code>#</code> followed by a newline,
with only whitespace (including comments) in between.  A null directive
is understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the
preprocessor output.  The primary significance of the existence of the
null directive is that an input line consisting of just a <code>#</code> will
produce no output, rather than a line of output containing just a
<code>#</code>.  Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines.

<h3 class="section">Preprocessor Output</h3>

<p>When the C preprocessor is used with the C, C++, or Objective-C
compilers, it is integrated into the compiler and communicates a stream
of binary tokens directly to the compiler's parser.  However, it can
also be used in the more conventional standalone mode, where it produces
textual output.

   <p>The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except
that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank
lines and all comments with spaces.  Long runs of blank lines are
discarded.

   <p>The ISO standard specifies that it is implementation defined whether a
preprocessor preserves whitespace between tokens, or replaces it with
e.g. a single space.  In GNU CPP, whitespace between tokens is collapsed
to become a single space, with the exception that the first token on a
non-directive line is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in
the same column in the preprocessed output that it appeared in the
original source file.  This is so the output is easy to read. 
See <a href="#Differences%20from%20previous%20versions">Differences from previous versions</a>.  CPP does not insert any
whitespace where there was none in the original source, except where
necessary to prevent an accidental token paste.

   <p>Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines
of the form

<pre class="example">     # <var>linenum</var> <var>filename</var> <var>flags</var>
     </pre>

<p>These are called <dfn>linemarkers</dfn>.  They are inserted as needed into
the output (but never within a string or character constant).  They mean
that the following line originated in file <var>filename</var> at line
<var>linenum</var>.  <var>filename</var> will never contain any non-printing
characters; they are replaced with octal escape sequences.

   <p>After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are <code>1</code>,
<code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>.  If there are multiple flags, spaces
separate them.  Here is what the flags mean:

     <dl>
<dt><code>1</code>
     <dd>This indicates the start of a new file. 
<br><dt><code>2</code>
     <dd>This indicates returning to a file (after having included another file). 
<br><dt><code>3</code>
     <dd>This indicates that the following text comes from a system header file,
so certain warnings should be suppressed. 
<br><dt><code>4</code>
     <dd>This indicates that the following text should be treated as being
wrapped in an implicit <code>extern "C"</code> block. 
</dl>

   <p>As an extension, the preprocessor accepts linemarkers in non-assembler
input files.  They are treated like the corresponding <code>#line</code>
directive, (see <a href="#Line%20Control">Line Control</a>), except that trailing flags are
permitted, and are interpreted with the meanings described above.  If
multiple flags are given, they must be in ascending order.

   <p>Some directives may be duplicated in the output of the preprocessor. 
These are <code>#ident</code> (always), <code>#pragma</code> (only if the
preprocessor does not handle the pragma itself), and <code>#define</code> and
<code>#undef</code> (with certain debugging options).  If this happens, the
<code>#</code> of the directive will always be in the first column, and there
will be no space between the <code>#</code> and the directive name.  If macro
expansion happens to generate tokens which might be mistaken for a
duplicated directive, a space will be inserted between the <code>#</code> and
the directive name.

<h3 class="section">Traditional Mode</h3>

<p>Traditional (pre-standard) C preprocessing is rather different from
the preprocessing specified by the standard.  When GCC is given the
<code>-traditional-cpp</code> option, it attempts to emulate a traditional
preprocessor.

   <p>GCC versions 3.2 and later only support traditional mode semantics in
the preprocessor, and not in the compiler front ends.  This chapter
outlines the traditional preprocessor semantics we implemented.

   <p>The implementation does not correspond precisely to the behavior of
earlier versions of GCC, nor to any true traditional preprocessor. 
After all, inconsistencies among traditional implementations were a
major motivation for C standardization.  However, we intend that it
should be compatible with true traditional preprocessors in all ways
that actually matter.

<h3 class="subsection">Traditional lexical analysis</h4>

<p>The traditional preprocessor does not decompose its input into tokens
the same way a standards-conforming preprocessor does.  The input is
simply treated as a stream of text with minimal internal form.

   <p>This implementation does not treat trigraphs (see <a href="#trigraphs">trigraphs</a>)
specially since they were an invention of the standards committee.  It
handles arbitrarily-positioned escaped newlines properly and splices
the lines as you would expect; many traditional preprocessors did not
do this.

   <p>The form of horizontal whitespace in the input file is preserved in
the output.  In particular, hard tabs remain hard tabs.  This can be
useful if, for example, you are preprocessing a Makefile.

   <p>Traditional CPP only recognizes C-style block comments, and treats the
<code>/*</code> sequence as introducing a comment only if it lies outside
quoted text.  Quoted text is introduced by the usual single and double
quotes, and also by an initial <code>&lt;</code> in a <code>#include</code>
directive.

   <p>Traditionally, comments are completely removed and are not replaced
with a space.  Since a traditional compiler does its own tokenization
of the output of the preprocessor, this means that comments can
effectively be used as token paste operators.  However, comments
behave like separators for text handled by the preprocessor itself,
since it doesn't re-lex its input.  For example, in

<pre class="smallexample">     #if foo/**/bar
     </pre>

<p><code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are distinct identifiers and expanded
separately if they happen to be macros.  In other words, this
directive is equivalent to

<pre class="smallexample">     #if foo bar
     </pre>

<p>rather than

<pre class="smallexample">     #if foobar
     </pre>

   <p>Generally speaking, in traditional mode an opening quote need not have
a matching closing quote.  In particular, a macro may be defined with
replacement text that contains an unmatched quote.  Of course, if you
attempt to compile preprocessed output containing an unmatched quote
you will get a syntax error.

   <p>However, all preprocessing directives other than <code>#define</code>
require matching quotes.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define m This macro's fine and has an unmatched quote
     "/* This is not a comment.  */
     /* This is a comment.  The following #include directive
        is ill-formed.  */
     #include &lt;stdio.h
     </pre>

   <p>Just as for the ISO preprocessor, what would be a closing quote can be
escaped with a backslash to prevent the quoted text from closing.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Traditional macros</h4>

<p>The major difference between traditional and ISO macros is that the
former expand to text rather than to a token sequence.  CPP removes
all leading and trailing horizontal whitespace from a macro's
replacement text before storing it, but preserves the form of internal
whitespace.

   <p>One consequence is that it is legitimate for the replacement text to
contain an unmatched quote (see <a href="#Traditional%20lexical%20analysis">Traditional lexical analysis</a>). An
unclosed string or character constant continues into the text
following the macro call.  Similarly, the text at the end of a macro's
expansion can run together with the text after the macro invocation to
produce a single token.

   <p>Normally comments are removed from the replacement text after the
macro is expanded, but if the <code>-CC</code> option is passed on the
command line comments are preserved.  (In fact, the current
implementation removes comments even before saving the macro
replacement text, but it careful to do it in such a way that the
observed effect is identical even in the function-like macro case.)

   <p>The ISO stringification operator <code>#</code> and token paste operator
<code>##</code> have no special meaning.  As explained later, an effect
similar to these operators can be obtained in a different way.  Macro
names that are embedded in quotes, either from the main file or after
macro replacement, do not expand.

   <p>CPP replaces an unquoted object-like macro name with its replacement
text, and then rescans it for further macros to replace.  Unlike
standard macro expansion, traditional macro expansion has no provision
to prevent recursion.  If an object-like macro appears unquoted in its
replacement text, it will be replaced again during the rescan pass,
and so on <em>ad infinitum</em>.  GCC detects when it is expanding
recursive macros, emits an error message, and continues after the
offending macro invocation.

<pre class="smallexample">     #define PLUS +
     #define INC(x) PLUS+x
     INC(foo);
          ==&gt; ++foo;
     </pre>

   <p>Function-like macros are similar in form but quite different in
behavior to their ISO counterparts.  Their arguments are contained
within parentheses, are comma-separated, and can cross physical lines. 
Commas within nested parentheses are not treated as argument
separators.  Similarly, a quote in an argument cannot be left
unclosed; a following comma or parenthesis that comes before the
closing quote is treated like any other character.  There is no
facility for handling variadic macros.

   <p>This implementation removes all comments from macro arguments, unless
the <code>-C</code> option is given.  The form of all other horizontal
whitespace in arguments is preserved, including leading and trailing
whitespace.  In particular

<pre class="smallexample">     f( )
     </pre>

<p>is treated as an invocation of the macro <code>f</code> with a single
argument consisting of a single space.  If you want to invoke a
function-like macro that takes no arguments, you must not leave any
whitespace between the parentheses.

   <p>If a macro argument crosses a new line, the new line is replaced with
a space when forming the argument.  If the previous line contained an
unterminated quote, the following line inherits the quoted state.

   <p>Traditional preprocessors replace parameters in the replacement text
with their arguments regardless of whether the parameters are within
quotes or not.  This provides a way to stringize arguments.  For
example

<pre class="smallexample">     #define str(x) "x"
     str(/* A comment */some text )
          ==&gt; "some text "
     </pre>

<p>Note that the comment is removed, but that the trailing space is
preserved.  Here is an example of using a comment to effect token
pasting.

<pre class="smallexample">     #define suffix(x) foo_/**/x
     suffix(bar)
          ==&gt; foo_bar
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Traditional miscellany</h4>

<p>Here are some things to be aware of when using the traditional
preprocessor.

     <ul>
<li>Preprocessing directives are recognized only when their leading
<code>#</code> appears in the first column.  There can be no whitespace
between the beginning of the line and the <code>#</code>, but whitespace can
follow the <code>#</code>.

     <li>A true traditional C preprocessor does not recognize <code>#error</code> or
<code>#pragma</code>, and may not recognize <code>#elif</code>.  CPP supports all
the directives in traditional mode that it supports in ISO mode,
including extensions, with the exception that the effects of
<code>#pragma GCC poison</code> are undefined.

     <li>__STDC__ is not defined.

     <li>If you use digraphs the behavior is undefined.

     <li>If a line that looks like a directive appears within macro arguments,
the behavior is undefined.

<h3 class="subsection">Traditional warnings</h4>

<p>You can request warnings about features that did not exist, or worked
differently, in traditional C with the <code>-Wtraditional</code> option. 
GCC does not warn about features of ISO C which you must use when you
are using a conforming compiler, such as the <code>#</code> and <code>##</code>
operators.

   <p>Presently <code>-Wtraditional</code> warns about:

     <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.

     <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the <code>#</code> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<code>-Wtraditional</code> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the <code>#</code> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.

     <li>A function-like macro that appears without an argument list.  In some
traditional preprocessors this was an error.  In ISO C it merely means
that the macro is not expanded.

     <li>The unary plus operator.  This did not exist in traditional C.

     <li>The <code>U</code> and <code>LL</code> integer constant suffixes, which were not
available in traditional C.  (Traditional C does support the <code>L</code>
suffix for simple long integer constants.)  You are not warned about
uses of these suffixes in macros defined in system headers.  For
instance, <code>UINT_MAX</code> may well be defined as <code>4294967295U</code>, but
you will not be warned if you use <code>UINT_MAX</code>.

     <p>You can usually avoid the warning, and the related warning about
constants which are so large that they are unsigned, by writing the
integer constant in question in hexadecimal, with no U suffix.  Take
care, though, because this gives the wrong result in exotic cases.

<p>Here we document details of how the preprocessor's implementation
affects its user-visible behavior.  You should try to avoid undue
reliance on behavior described here, as it is possible that it will
change subtly in future implementations.

   <p>Also documented here are obsolete features and changes from previous
versions of CPP.

<h3 class="subsection">Implementation-defined behavior</h4>

<p>This is how CPP behaves in all the cases which the C standard
describes as <dfn>implementation-defined</dfn>.  This term means that the
implementation is free to do what it likes, but must document its choice
and stick to it.

     <ul>
<li>The mapping of physical source file multi-byte characters to the
execution character set.

     <p>Currently, GNU cpp only supports character sets that are strict supersets
of ASCII, and performs no translation of characters.

     </p><li>Non-empty sequences of whitespace characters.

     <p>In textual output, each whitespace sequence is collapsed to a single
space.  For aesthetic reasons, the first token on each non-directive
line of output is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in the
same column as it did in the original source file.

     </p><li>The numeric value of character constants in preprocessor expressions.

     <p>The preprocessor and compiler interpret character constants in the
same way; i.e. escape sequences such as <code>\a</code> are given the
values they would have on the target machine.

     <p>The compiler values a multi-character character constant a character
at a time, shifting the previous value left by the number of bits per
target character, and then or-ing in the bit-pattern of the new
character truncated to the width of a target character.  The final
bit-pattern is given type <code>int</code>, and is therefore signed,
regardless of whether single characters are signed or not (a slight
change from versions 3.1 and earlier of GCC).  If there are more
characters in the constant than would fit in the target <code>int</code> the
compiler issues a warning, and the excess leading characters are
ignored.

     <p>For example, 'ab' for a target with an 8-bit <code>char</code> would be
interpreted as (int)&nbsp;((unsigned&nbsp;char)&nbsp;'a'&nbsp;*&nbsp;256&nbsp;+&nbsp;(unsigned&nbsp;char)&nbsp;'b'), and '\234a' as (int)&nbsp;((unsigned&nbsp;char)&nbsp;'\234'&nbsp;*&nbsp;256&nbsp;+&nbsp;(unsigned&nbsp;char)&nbsp;'a').

     </p><li>Source file inclusion.

     <p>For a discussion on how the preprocessor locates header files,
<a href="#Include%20Operation">Include Operation</a>.

     </p><li>Interpretation of the filename resulting from a macro-expanded
<code>#include</code> directive.

     <p>See <a href="#Computed%20Includes">Computed Includes</a>.

     </p><li>Treatment of a <code>#pragma</code> directive that after macro-expansion
results in a standard pragma.

     <p>No macro expansion occurs on any <code>#pragma</code> directive line, so the
question does not arise.

     <p>Note that GCC does not yet implement any of the standard
pragmas.

<h3 class="subsection">Implementation limits</h4>

<p>CPP has a small number of internal limits.  This section lists the
limits which the C standard requires to be no lower than some minimum,
and all the others we are aware of.  We intend there to be as few limits
as possible.  If you encounter an undocumented or inconvenient limit,
please report that to us as a bug.  (See the section on reporting bugs in
the GCC manual.)

   <p>Where we say something is limited <dfn>only by available memory</dfn>, that
means that internal data structures impose no intrinsic limit, and space
is allocated with <code>malloc</code> or equivalent.  The actual limit will
therefore depend on many things, such as the size of other things
allocated by the compiler at the same time, the amount of memory
consumed by other processes on the same computer, etc.

     <ul>

     <li>Nesting levels of <code>#include</code> files.

     <p>We impose an arbitrary limit of 200 levels, to avoid runaway recursion. 
The standard requires at least 15 levels.

     </p><li>Nesting levels of conditional inclusion.

     <p>The C standard mandates this be at least 63.  CPP is limited only by
available memory.

     </p><li>Levels of parenthesized expressions within a full expression.

     <p>The C standard requires this to be at least 63.  In preprocessor
conditional expressions, it is limited only by available memory.

     </p><li>Significant initial characters in an identifier or macro name.

     <p>The preprocessor treats all characters as significant.  The C standard
requires only that the first 63 be significant.

     </p><li>Number of macros simultaneously defined in a single translation unit.

     <p>The standard requires at least 4095 be possible.  CPP is limited only
by available memory.

     </p><li>Number of parameters in a macro definition and arguments in a macro call.

     <p>We allow <code>USHRT_MAX</code>, which is no smaller than 65,535.  The minimum
required by the standard is 127.

     </p><li>Number of characters on a logical source line.

     <p>The C standard requires a minimum of 4096 be permitted.  CPP places
no limits on this, but you may get incorrect column numbers reported in
diagnostics for lines longer than 65,535 characters.

     </p><li>Maximum size of a source file.

     <p>The standard does not specify any lower limit on the maximum size of a
source file.  GNU cpp maps files into memory, so it is limited by the
available address space.  This is generally at least two gigabytes. 
Depending on the operating system, the size of physical memory may or
may not be a limitation.

<h3 class="subsection">Obsolete Features</h4>

<p>CPP has a number of features which are present mainly for
compatibility with older programs.  We discourage their use in new code. 
In some cases, we plan to remove the feature in a future version of GCC.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Assertions</h5>

<p><dfn>Assertions</dfn> are a deprecated alternative to macros in writing
conditionals to test what sort of computer or system the compiled
program will run on.  Assertions are usually predefined, but you can
define them with preprocessing directives or command-line options.

   <p>Assertions were intended to provide a more systematic way to describe
the compiler's target system.  However, in practice they are just as
unpredictable as the system-specific predefined macros.  In addition, they
are not part of any standard, and only a few compilers support them. 
Therefore, the use of assertions is <strong>less</strong> portable than the use
of system-specific predefined macros.  We recommend you do not use them at
all.

   <p>An assertion looks like this:

<pre class="example">     #<var>predicate</var> (<var>answer</var>)
     </pre>

<p><var>predicate</var> must be a single identifier.  <var>answer</var> can be any
sequence of tokens; all characters are significant except for leading
and trailing whitespace, and differences in internal whitespace
sequences are ignored.  (This is similar to the rules governing macro
redefinition.)  Thus, <code>(x + y)</code> is different from <code>(x+y)</code> but
equivalent to <code>(&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y&nbsp;)</code>.  Parentheses do not nest inside an
answer.

   <p>To test an assertion, you write it in an <code>#if</code>.  For example, this
conditional succeeds if either <code>vax</code> or <code>ns16000</code> has been
asserted as an answer for <code>machine</code>.

<pre class="example">     #if #machine (vax) || #machine (ns16000)
     </pre>

<p>You can test whether <em>any</em> answer is asserted for a predicate by
omitting the answer in the conditional:

<pre class="example">     #if #machine
     </pre>

   <p>Assertions are made with the <code>#assert</code> directive.  Its sole
argument is the assertion to make, without the leading <code>#</code> that
identifies assertions in conditionals.

<pre class="example">     #assert <var>predicate</var> (<var>answer</var>)
     </pre>

<p>You may make several assertions with the same predicate and different
answers.  Subsequent assertions do not override previous ones for the
same predicate.  All the answers for any given predicate are
simultaneously true.

   <p>Assertions can be canceled with the <code>#unassert</code> directive.  It
has the same syntax as <code>#assert</code>.  In that form it cancels only the
answer which was specified on the <code>#unassert</code> line; other answers
for that predicate remain true.  You can cancel an entire predicate by
leaving out the answer:

<pre class="example">     #unassert <var>predicate</var>
     </pre>

<p>In either form, if no such assertion has been made, <code>#unassert</code> has
no effect.

   <p>You can also make or cancel assertions using command line options.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Obsolete once-only headers</h5>

<p>CPP supports two more ways of indicating that a header file should be
read only once.  Neither one is as portable as a wrapper <code>#ifndef</code>,
and we recommend you do not use them in new programs.

   <p>In the Objective-C language, there is a variant of <code>#include</code>
called <code>#import</code> which includes a file, but does so at most once. 
If you use <code>#import</code> instead of <code>#include</code>, then you don't
need the conditionals inside the header file to prevent multiple
inclusion of the contents.  GCC permits the use of <code>#import</code> in C
and C++ as well as Objective-C.  However, it is not in standard C or C++
and should therefore not be used by portable programs.

   <p><code>#import</code> is not a well designed feature.  It requires the users of
a header file to know that it should only be included once.  It is much
better for the header file's implementor to write the file so that users
don't need to know this.  Using a wrapper <code>#ifndef</code> accomplishes
this goal.

   <p>In the present implementation, a single use of <code>#import</code> will
prevent the file from ever being read again, by either <code>#import</code> or
<code>#include</code>.  You should not rely on this; do not use both
<code>#import</code> and <code>#include</code> to refer to the same header file.

   <p>Another way to prevent a header file from being included more than once
is with the <code>#pragma once</code> directive.  If <code>#pragma once</code> is
seen when scanning a header file, that file will never be read again, no
matter what.

   <p><code>#pragma once</code> does not have the problems that <code>#import</code> does,
but it is not recognized by all preprocessors, so you cannot rely on it
in a portable program.

<h3 class="subsection">Differences from previous versions</h4>

<p>This section details behavior which has changed from previous versions
of CPP.  We do not plan to change it again in the near future, but
we do not promise not to, either.

   <p>The "previous versions" discussed here are 2.95 and before.  The
behavior of GCC 3.0 is mostly the same as the behavior of the widely
used 2.96 and 2.97 development snapshots.  Where there are differences,
they generally represent bugs in the snapshots.

     <ul>

     <li>Order of evaluation of <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> operators

     <p>The standard does not specify the order of evaluation of a chain of
<code>##</code> operators, nor whether <code>#</code> is evaluated before, after, or
at the same time as <code>##</code>.  You should therefore not write any code
which depends on any specific ordering.  It is possible to guarantee an
ordering, if you need one, by suitable use of nested macros.

     <p>An example of where this might matter is pasting the arguments <code>1</code>,
<code>e</code> and <code>-2</code>.  This would be fine for left-to-right pasting,
but right-to-left pasting would produce an invalid token <code>e-2</code>.

     <p>GCC 3.0 evaluates <code>#</code> and <code>##</code> at the same time and strictly
left to right.  Older versions evaluated all <code>#</code> operators first,
then all <code>##</code> operators, in an unreliable order.

     </p><li>The form of whitespace between tokens in preprocessor output

     <p>See <a href="#Preprocessor%20Output">Preprocessor Output</a>, for the current textual format.  This is
also the format used by stringification.  Normally, the preprocessor
communicates tokens directly to the compiler's parser, and whitespace
does not come up at all.

     <p>Older versions of GCC preserved all whitespace provided by the user and
inserted lots more whitespace of their own, because they could not
accurately predict when extra spaces were needed to prevent accidental
token pasting.

     </p><li>Optional argument when invoking rest argument macros

     <p>As an extension, GCC permits you to omit the variable arguments entirely
when you use a variable argument macro.  This is forbidden by the 1999 C
standard, and will provoke a pedantic warning with GCC 3.0.  Previous
versions accepted it silently.

     </p><li><code>##</code> swallowing preceding text in rest argument macros

     <p>Formerly, in a macro expansion, if <code>##</code> appeared before a variable
arguments parameter, and the set of tokens specified for that argument
in the macro invocation was empty, previous versions of CPP would
back up and remove the preceding sequence of non-whitespace characters
(<strong>not</strong> the preceding token).  This extension is in direct
conflict with the 1999 C standard and has been drastically pared back.

     <p>In the current version of the preprocessor, if <code>##</code> appears between
a comma and a variable arguments parameter, and the variable argument is
omitted entirely, the comma will be removed from the expansion.  If the
variable argument is empty, or the token before <code>##</code> is not a
comma, then <code>##</code> behaves as a normal token paste.

     </p><li><code>#line</code> and <code>#include</code>

     <p>The <code>#line</code> directive used to change GCC's notion of the
"directory containing the current file," used by <code>#include</code> with
a double-quoted header file name.  In 3.0 and later, it does not. 
See <a href="#Line%20Control">Line Control</a>, for further explanation.

     </p><li>Syntax of <code>#line</code>

     <p>In GCC 2.95 and previous, the string constant argument to <code>#line</code>
was treated the same way as the argument to <code>#include</code>: backslash
escapes were not honored, and the string ended at the second <code>"</code>. 
This is not compliant with the C standard.  In GCC 3.0, an attempt was
made to correct the behavior, so that the string was treated as a real
string constant, but it turned out to be buggy.  In 3.1, the bugs have
been fixed.  (We are not fixing the bugs in 3.0 because they affect
relatively few people and the fix is quite invasive.)

<h3 class="section">Invocation</h3>

<p>Most often when you use the C preprocessor you will not have to invoke it
explicitly: the C compiler will do so automatically.  However, the
preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own.  All the options listed
here are also acceptable to the C compiler and have the same meaning,
except that the C compiler has different rules for specifying the output
file.

   <p><strong>Note:</strong> Whether you use the preprocessor by way of <code>gcc</code>
or <code>cpp</code>, the <dfn>compiler driver</dfn> is run first.  This
program's purpose is to translate your command into invocations of the
programs that do the actual work.  Their command line interfaces are
similar but not identical to the documented interface, and may change
without notice.

   <p>The C preprocessor expects two file names as arguments, <var>infile</var> and
<var>outfile</var>.  The preprocessor reads <var>infile</var> together with any
other files it specifies with <code>#include</code>.  All the output generated
by the combined input files is written in <var>outfile</var>.

   <p>Either <var>infile</var> or <var>outfile</var> may be <code>-</code>, which as
<var>infile</var> means to read from standard input and as <var>outfile</var>
means to write to standard output.  Also, if either file is omitted, it
means the same as if <code>-</code> had been specified for that file.

   <p>Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <code>=</code>, all options
which take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately
after the option, or with a space between option and argument:
<code>-Ifoo</code> and <code>-I foo</code> have the same effect.

   <p>Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
options may <em>not</em> be grouped: <code>-dM</code> is very different from
<code>-d&nbsp;-M</code>.

using the ASCII character set or the Unicode character set, but you
could also use the ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code set, along with
trigraph sequences.  All sample code in this manual was created
using the ASCII character set.

<p>Identifiers are strings of characters used for naming variables,
functions, new data types, and preprocessor macros.  The characters
can be letters, decimal digits, the underscore character <code>_</code>,
or the dollar sign character <code>$</code>.  The first character of an
identifier cannot be a digit.  Lowercase letters and uppercase letters
are distinct, so <code>squid</code> and <code>Squid</code> are two different
identifiers.

<p>A constant is a literal numeric or character value, such as

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Integer Constants</h5>

<p>An integer constant is a sequence of digits.  If the sequence of digits
is preceded by <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code> (zero x or zero X), then it is
assumed to be hexadecimal (base 16).  Hexadecimal values may use the
digits from 0 to 9, as well as the letters <code>a</code> to <code>f</code>, or
<code>A</code> to <code>F</code>.

<pre class="example">     /* Assigning a hexadecimal value to a variable. */
     
     x = 0x2F;
     </pre>

   <p>If the first digit is 0 (zero), and the second digit is not <code>x</code> or
<code>X</code>, then the sequence of digits is assumed to be octal (base 8). 
Octal values may only use the digits from 0 to 7; 8 and 9 are not allowed.

<pre class="example">     /* Assigning an octal value to a variable. */
     
     x = 057;
     </pre>

<p>A 0 (zero) by itself is an octal value; often, it is preceded by
an additional 0 to make it obvious that it is octal.

   <p>In all other cases, the sequence of digits is assumed to be
decimal (base 10).  Decimal values may use the digits from
0 to 9.

<pre class="example">     /* Assigning a decimal value to a variable. */
     
     x = 47;
     </pre>

   <p>There are various integer data types, such as <code>int</code>,
<code>unsigned int</code>, and <code>long int</code>.  You can append a sequence
of one or more letters to the end of an integer constant to cause
it to be of a certain integer data type.  The letters that you can
use (and their meanings) are:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>u</code>
     <dd><br><dt><code>U</code>
     <dd>Unsigned integer type.

     <br><dt><code>l</code>
     <dd><br><dt><code>L</code>
     <dd>Long integer type.

   </dl>

   <p>For example, <code>45U</code> is an <code>unsigned int</code> constant.  You can
also combine letters: <code>45UL</code> is an <code>unsigned long int</code> constant. 
(The letters may be used in any order.)  You can use two <code>L</code>'s to
get a <code>long long int</code> constant; add a <code>U</code> and you have an
<code>unsigned long long int</code> constant.

   <p>There is no way to force an integer constant to be interpreted
a short integer.  In addition, an integer constant will never be
interpreted as a short integer by default, even if its value is
small enough to be represented as one.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Character Constants</h5>

<p>A character constant is a sequence of one or more characters enclosed
within single quotation marks, such as <code>'Q'</code>.  A character constant
is of type <code>int</code>.

   <p>In most cases, the value of a character constant is the character which
is enclosed within the single quotation marks; however, some characters,
such as the single quotation mark character <code>'</code> itself, cannot be
represented using only one character.  To represent such characters,
there are several "escape sequences" that you can use:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>\\</code>
     <dd>Backslash character.

     <br><dt><code>\?</code>
     <dd>Question mark character.

     <br><dt><code>\'</code>
     <dd>Single quotation mark.

     <br><dt><code>\"</code>
     <dd>Double quotation mark.

     <br><dt><code>\a</code>
     <dd>Audible alert.

     <br><dt><code>\b</code>
     <dd>Backspace character.

     <br><dt><code>\e</code>
     <dd>&lt;ESC&gt; character.

     <br><dt><code>\f</code>
     <dd>Form feed.

     <br><dt><code>\n</code>
     <dd>Newline character.

     <br><dt><code>\r</code>
     <dd>Carriage return.

     <br><dt><code>\t</code>
     <dd>Horizontal tab.

     <br><dt><code>\v</code>
     <dd>Vertical tab.

     <br><dt><code>\ooo</code>
     <dd>Octal number.

     <br><dt><code>\xhh</code>
     <dd>Hexadecimal number.

   </dl>

   <p>To use any of these escape sequences, enclose the sequence in single
quotes, and treat it is if it were any other character.  For example,
the letter m is <code>'m'</code> and the newline character is <code>'\n'</code>.

   <p>The octal number escape sequence is the backslash character followed by
one, two, or three octal digits (0 to 7). For example, 101 is the
octal equivalent of 65, which is the ASCII character <code>'A'</code>. Thus,
the character constant <code>'\101'</code> is the same as the character
constant <code>'A'</code>.

   <p>The hexadecimal escape sequence is the backslash character, followed
by <code>x</code> and an unlimited number of hexadecimal digits (0 to 9, and
<code>a</code> to <code>f</code> or <code>A</code> to <code>F</code>).

   <p>Since we are dealing with character constants, and the number of
hexadecimal digits is unlimited, but the range of characters is not,
please use some common sense.  There is no need to refer to the
394,203,192,245th character if there are only 256 characters to
choose from.  If you try to use a hexadecimal value that is outside
the range of characters, you will get a compile-time error.

   <p>You can make a character constant a "wide" character by appending
the letter L to it, outside of the quotation marks.  For example,
<code>L'm'</code>, and is of the data type <code>wchar_t</code> (defined in the
&lt;stddef.h&gt; header file).

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Floating Point Constants</h5>

<p>A floating point constant is a value that represents a fractional
number.  It consists of a sequence of digits which represents the
integer (or "whole") part of the number, a decimal point, and
a sequence of digits which represents the fractional part.

   <p>The integer part and the fractional part are not both required.  If
you leave out the integer part, then the decimal point is necessary. 
If you leave out the decimal part, then the decimal point is optional. 
You can't leave out both the integer <em>and</em> the decimal parts;
that would cause a compile time error, and it would be a rather strange
thing to do anyway.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     /* Assigning floating point constants to variables. */
     
     a = 4.7;     /* This is okay. */
     
     b = 4.;      /* This is okay. */
     
     c = 4;       /* This is okay. */
     
     d = .7;      /* This is okay. */
     
     e = 0.7;     /* This is okay. */
     
     f = .;       /* This is NOT okay! */
     </pre>

   <p>Floating point constants can also be followed by <code>e</code> or
<code>E</code>, and an integer exponent.  The exponent can be positive
or negative, but you can't leave it out (unless you want a compile-time
error).

<pre class="example">     /* Assigning a floating point constant with exponent. */
     
     x = 5e2;   /* <code>x</code> is 500.0. */
     y = 5e-2;  /* <code>y</code> is 0.05. */
     </pre>

   <p>You can append a letter to the end of a floating point constant
to cause it to be of a certain data type.  If you append the letter
F (or f) to a floating point constant, then its type is <code>float</code>. 
If you append the letter L (or l), then its type is <code>long double</code>. 
If you do not append any letters, then its type is <code>double</code>.

<h3 class="subsection">String Literals</h4>

<p>A string literal, or string constant, is a sequence of
characters, digits, and/or escape sequences enclosed within
double quotation marks.  A string literal is of type "array
of characters".

   <p>Adjacent string literals are concatenated (combined) into
one string.  After this, the null character <code>\0</code> is
added to the end of the string.  The null character is used
to indicate where the string ends.  All string literals
contain the null character as their last character, even if it
is not explicitly stated.

   <p>A string cannot contain double quotation marks, as double
quotation marks are used to enclose the string.  To include
the double quotation mark character in a string, use the <code>\"</code>
escape sequence.  You can use any of the escape sequences that can
be used as character constants in strings.  Here are some example
of string literals:

<pre class="example">     /* This is a single string literal. */
     "tutti frutti ice cream"
     
     /* These three string literals will be concatenated. */
     "pistachio " "ice " "cream"
     
     /* This one uses two escape sequences. */
     "\"Hello, world!\""
     </pre>

   <p>You can use wide characters in a string by using the <code>L</code>
prefix, such as <code>L"chocolate"</code>.  If a string uses wide
characters, then its data type is "array of wchar_t".  You can
concatenate wide strings with normal strings, and the resulting
string is a wide string.

<h3 class="subsection">Operators</h4>

<p>An operator is a token that performs an operation, such as
addition or subtraction, on either one, two, or three operands. 
Many operators are one character long, but some are more than
that.  Full coverage of operators can be found in a separate
chapter, but here are some examples: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>,
and <code>||</code>.  See <a href="#Expressions%20and%20Operators">Expressions and Operators</a>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Separators</h4>

<p>A separator is a token that is used to separate parts of
an expression.  White space is a separator, but it is not a token. 
The other separators are:

<pre class="example">     ( ) [ ] { } ; , . :
     </pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Comments</h3>

<p>A comment is a section of a program's source code used to describe
the program.  During the early stages of a program's compilation, all
comments are replaced with a single spaces.  A comment
begins with the characters <code>/*</code> and ends with the characters
<code>*/</code>.

<pre class="example">     /* This is a comment. */
     
     x = 47;    /* <code>x</code> is now 47. */
     
     /* This is also a comment. */
     </pre>

   <p>You can also use C++-style comments.  You put the characters <code>//</code> where
you want the comment to begin, and the rest of that line is a comment. 
Anything on the line prior to the comment characters remains uncommented.

<pre class="example">     x = 47;    // <code>x</code> is now 47.
     </pre>

   <p>Regular (non C++-style) comments cannot be nested; that is, one comment
cannot exist within another comment.  For example, this won't work:

<pre class="example">     /* This is a /* comment. */ */
     </pre>

   <p>The above example will not compile because the <code>*/</code> that ends
the inner comment also ends the outer comment, which leaves an
unmatched <code>*/</code> at the end of the line.  You can put C++-style
comments inside regular comments, though:

<pre class="example">     /* This is a // comment. */
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="section">White Space</h3>

<p><dfn>White space</dfn> is the collective term used for a number of
characters, including the space character, the tab character,
and the newline character.  In C programs, white space is
ignored, and is therefore optional, except when it is used to
separate tokens.  This means that

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
     
     int
     main()
     {
       printf( "hi there\n" );
       return 0;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>and

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; int main(){printf("hi there\n");
     return 0;}
     </pre>

<p>are functionally the same program.  Certainly, the second
of those examples looks a bit confusing, but they both do the
same thing.

   <p>Although you must use white space to separate most tokens, no
white space is required between operators and operands, nor is
it required between separators and that which they separate.

<pre class="example">     /* All of these are valid. */
     
     x++;
     x ++ ;
     x=y+z;
     x = y + z ;
     x=array[2];
     x = array [ 2 ] ;
     fraction=numerator/*denominator_ptr;
     fraction = numerator / * denominator_ptr ;
     </pre>

   <p>Furthermore, wherever one space is allowed, any white space
is allowed.

<pre class="example">     /* These two statements are functionally identical. */
     x++;
     
     x
            ++       ;
     </pre>

   <p>In string literals, spaces and tabs are not ignored; rather, they are
part of the string.  Therefore,

<pre class="example">     "potato knish"
     </pre>

<p>is not the same as

<pre class="example">     "potato                        knish"
     </pre>

   <p>If a string is too long to fit on one line, you can use a slash <code>/</code>
to break it up onto separate lines.

<pre class="example">     /* This is <em>not</em> a valid string. */
     "Today's special is a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with
     a potato knish and a cherry soda."
     
     /* This <em>is</em> valid. */
     "Today's special is a pastrami sandwich on rye bread with /
     a potato knish and a cherry soda."
     </pre>

   <p>The slash <code>/</code> works, but you have another option.  Adjacent
strings are automatically concatenated, so you can have strings span multiple
lines by writing them as several separate, yet adjacent, strings.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     "Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on "
     "pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."
     </pre>

<p>is the same as

<pre class="example">     "Tomorrow's special is a corned beef sandwich on /
     pumpernickel bread with a kasha knish and seltzer water."
     </pre>

   <p>To force a newline character into the string, so that when the string
is printed it will be printed on two different lines, you can use the newline
escape sequence <code>\n</code>.

<pre class="example">     printf ("potato\nknish");
     </pre>

<p>prints

<pre class="example">     potato
     knish
     </pre>

<h2 class="chapter">Data Types</h2>

<p>There are various data types that you can use in C, including primitive
data types for numbers and characters, and more complex data types for
arrays and structures.  This chapter describes the primitive data types,
along with some key concepts about C data types in general, but defers
descriptions of complex data types to later chapters.

<h3 class="section">Integer Data Types</h3>

<p>The integer data types range in size from at least 8 bits to at least 64 bits. 
You should use them for storing whole number values (and the <code>char</code>
data type for storing characters).  (Note that the sizes and ranges listed
for these types are minimums; your particular compiler may allow for larger
values.)

     <ul>

     <li><code>signed char</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 8-bit <code>signed char</code> data type can hold integer values in
the range of -128 to 127. 
</ul>

     <li><code>unsigned char</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 8-bit <code>unsigned char</code> data type can hold integer values in
the range of 0 to 255. 
</ul>

     <li><code>char</code>
          <ul>
<li>Depending on your system, the <code>char</code> data type is defined as
equivalent to either the <code>signed char</code> or the <code>unsigned char</code>
data type.  By convention, you should use the <code>char</code> data type
specifically for storing ASCII characters (such as `m') or escape
sequences (such as `\n'). 
</ul>

     <li><code>int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 32-bit <code>int</code> data type can hold integer values in the range
of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  You may also refer to this data type
as <code>signed int</code> or <code>signed</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>unsigned int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 32-bit <code>unsigned int</code> data type can hold integer values in
the range of 0 to 4,294,967,295.  You may also refer to this data type
simply as <code>unsigned</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>long int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 32-bit <code>long int</code> data type can hold integer values in
the range of at least -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  (Depending on
your system, this data type might be 64-bit, in which case its range is
identical to that of the <code>long long int</code> data type.)  You may also
refer to this data type as <code>long</code>, <code>signed long int</code>,
or <code>signed long</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>unsigned long int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 32-bit <code>unsigned long int</code> data type can hold integer values
in the range of at least 0 to 4,294,967,295.  (Depending on your
system, this data type might be 64-bit, in which case its range is
identical to that of the <code>unsigned long long int</code> data type.)  You may
also refer to this data type as <code>unsigned long</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>short int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 16-bit <code>short int</code> data type can hold integer values in the
range of -32,768 to 32,767.  You may also refer to this data type as
<code>short</code>, <code>signed short int</code>, or <code>signed short</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>unsigned short int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 16-bit <code>unsigned short int</code> data type can hold integer values
in the range of 0 to 65,535.  You may also refer to this data type
as <code>unsigned short</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>long long int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 64-bit <code>long int</code> data type can hold integer values in
the range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. You
may also refer to this data type as <code>long long</code>,
<code>signed long long int</code> or <code>signed long long</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>unsigned long long int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The 64-bit <code>unsigned long long int</code> data type can hold integer
values in the range of at least 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.  You may

<h3 class="section">Floating Point Data Types</h3>

<p>There are several data types that represent fractional numbers, such as
3.14159 and 2.83.  The exact sizes and ranges for the floating point data
types can vary from system to system; these values are stored in macro
definitions in the library header file <code>float.h</code>.  In this section,
we include the names of the macro definitions in place of their possible
values:

     <ul>

     <li><code>float</code>
          <ul>
<li>The <code>float</code> data type is the smallest of the three floating point
types, if they differ in size at all.  Its minimum value is stored in
the <code>FLT_MIN</code>, and is supposed to be no greater than 1e(-37). 
Its maximum value is stored in <code>FLT_MAX</code>, and is supposed to be no
less than 1e37. 
</ul>

     <li><code>double</code>
          <ul>
<li>The <code>double</code> data type is at least as large as the <code>float</code>
type, and it may be larger.  Its minimum value is stored in
<code>DBL_MIN</code>, and its maximum value is stored in <code>DBL_MAX</code>. 
</ul>

     <li><code>long double</code>
          <ul>
<li>The <code>long double</code> data type is at least as large as the
<code>float</code> type, and it may be larger.  Its minimum value is stored in
<code>LDBL_MIN</code>, and its maximum value is stored in <code>LDBL_MAX</code>. 
</ul>

   </ul>

   <p>All floating point data types are signed; if you attempt to use
<code>unsigned float</code>, for example, it will cause a compile-time error.

<h3 class="section">Complex Number Data Types</h3>

<p>GNU C provides support for complex data types.  You can declare complex
character types, complex integer types, and complex floating point
types using the keyword <code>__complex__</code>.  We won't give you a
complete list of all possibilities, since
<code>__complex__</code> can be used with any of the character, integer, or
floating point data types, but here are some examples:

     <ul>

     <li><code>__complex__ float</code>
          <ul>
<li>The <code>__complex__ float</code> data type has two components--a real
part and an imaginary part, both of which are of the <code>float</code> data type. 
</ul>

     <li><code>__complex__ int</code>
          <ul>
<li>The <code>__complex__ int</code> data type also has two components--a
real part and an imaginary part, both of which are of the <code>int</code> data
type. 
</ul>

   </ul>

   <p>To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression, use the keyword
<code>__real__</code>, followed by the expression.  Likewise, use <code>__imag__</code>
to extract the imaginary part.

<pre class="example">     __complex__ float a = 4 + 3i;
     
     float b = __real__ a;          /* <code>b</code> is now 4. */
     float c = __imag__ a;          /* <code>c</code> is now 3. */
     </pre>

   <p>That trivial example creates a complex floating point variable <code>a</code>,
and defines its real part as 4 and its imaginary part as 3.  Then, the
real part is assigned to the floating point variable <code>b</code>, and the
imaginary part is assigned to the floating point variable <code>c</code>.

<h3 class="section">Declaring Variables</h3>

<p>You must declare variables before you can use them.  To do so, you need
to specify the type and name of the variable, like this:

<pre class="example">     int i;
     float f;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares the variables <code>i</code> and <code>f</code>, which are of the
types <code>int</code> and <code>float</code>, respectively.

   <p>You can declare multiple variables of the same type in the same statement
by separating their names with commas, like this:

<pre class="example">     int a, b, c;
     </pre>

   <p>When you simply declare a variable, no value is assigned to it--all that
happens is the needed memory space is reserved, and the variable is given
its name and type.

<h3 class="section">Initializing Variables</h3>

<p>You can initialize a variable to a certain value when you declare by
including the assignment operator and a value for the variable in the
declaration.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     int i = 5;
     </pre>

   <p>You can also initialize multiple variables in the same statement.  You
can even initialize some of the variables in a single statement, but not
all of them, like this:

<pre class="example">     int a = 3, b, c = 4;
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, the variables <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> are both declared and
initialized, but <code>b</code> is only declared, and not initialized.

<p>An array is a data structure that lets you store zero or more elements
consecutively in memory.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Declaring Arrays</h3>

<p>You declare an array by specifying the data type for its elements, its name,
and the number of elements it can store.  Here is an example that declares
an array that can store ten integers:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[10];
     </pre>

   <p>The number of elements can be as small as zero, but it cannot be negative. 
Zero-length arrays are useful as the last element of a structure which is
really a header for a variable-length object:

<pre class="example">     struct line
     {
       int length;
       char contents[0];
     };
     
     {
       struct line *this_line = (struct line *)
         malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
       this_line -&gt; length = this_length;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>You can also declare an array size using a variable instead of a constant. 
For example, here is a function definition that declares an array using its
parameter as the number of elements:

<pre class="example">     int
     my_function (int number)
     {
       int my_array[number];
       ...;
     }
     </pre>

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Initializing Arrays</h3>

<p>You can initialize the elements in an array when you declare it by listing
the initializing values, separated by commas, in a set of braces.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[5] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
     </pre>

   <p>You don't have to initialize all of the array elements.  For example, this code
initializes only the first three elements:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[5] = { 0, 1, 2 };
     </pre>

<p>That leaves the last two elements uninitialized.

   <p>You can also initialize array elements out of order, by specifying which
array indices to initialize.  To do this, include the array index in brackets,
and optionally the assignment operator, before the value.  (The first
element in an array is at position 0, not 1.)  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[5] = { [2] 5, [4] 9 };
     </pre>

<p>Or, using the assignment operator:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[5] = { [2] = 5, [4] = 9 };
     </pre>

<p>Both of those examples are equivalent to:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[5] = { 0, 0, 5, 0, 9 };
     </pre>

   <p>You can also initialize a range of elements to the same
value, by specifying the first and last indices, in
the form <code> [</code><var>first</var><code>] ... [</code><var>last</var><code>] </code>.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="example">     int new_array[100] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 98] = 2, 3 };
     </pre>

   <p>That initializes elements 0 through 9 to 1, elements 10 through 98
to 2, and element 99 to 3.  (You also could explicitly write
<code>[99] = 3</code>.)  Also, notice that you <em>must</em> have spaces on both
sides of the <code>...</code>.

   <p>If you initialize every element of an array, then you do not have to
specify its size; its size is determined by the number of elements you
initialize.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 };
     </pre>

   <p>Although this does not explicitly state that the array has five elements
using <code>my_array[5]</code>, it initializes five elements, so that is how many
it has.

   <p>Alternately, if you specify which elements to initialize, then the size of
the array is equal to the highest element number initialized, plus one. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     int my_array[] = { 0, 1, 2, [99] = 99 };
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, only four elements are initialized, but the last one
initialized is element number 99, so there are 100 elements.  (In GNU C,
you start counting array elements with zero, not one.)

<h3 class="section">Accessing Array Elements</h3>

<p>You can access the elements of an array by specifying the array name,
followed by the element index, enclosed in brackets.  In C, the array
elements are numbered starting with zero, not one.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     my_array[0] = 5;
     </pre>

   <p>That assigns the value 5 to the first element in the array, at position
zero.  You can treat individual array elements like variables of whatever
data type the array is made up of.  For example, if you have an array made
of a structure data type, you can access the structure elements like this:

<pre class="example">     struct point
     {
       int x, y;
     };
     
     struct point point_array[2] = { {4, 5}, {8, 9} };
     
     point_array[0].x = 3;

You do this by adding an extra set of brackets and array lengths for every

both dimensions:

<h3 class="subsection">Declaring and Initializing String Arrays</h4>

<p>To use an array to hold a string, you create a character array.  You can use
either signed or unsigned characters.

   <p>When you declare the array, you can specify the number of elements it will
have.  That number will be the maximum number of characters that should be
in the string, including the null character used to end the string.  If you
choose this option, then you do not have to initialize the array when you
declare it.  Alternately, you can choose not to explicitly state the number of
elements the array will have.  In this case, you must initialize the array,
and then its size will be exactly large enough to hold whatever string you
used to initialize it.

   <p>There are two different ways to initialize the array.  You can specify of
comma-delimited list of characters enclosed in braces, or you can specify a
string literal enclosed in double quotation marks.

   <p>Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     char blue[26];  // This array can hold 26 characters, including
                     // the null character.
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     char yellow[26] = {'y', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'w'};
     
     char orange[26] = "orange";
     
     char gray[] = {'g', 'r', 'a', 'y'};
     
     char salmon[] = "salmon";
     </pre>

   <p>In all of those cases, the null character <code>\0</code> is automatically be
appended to the end of each string, even though it was not explicitly included.

   <p>Both <code>yellow</code> and <code>orange</code> can hold 26 characters; in the above
example, only seven were used.  So you could still change what characters
are in them, using up to 26 characters.  However, <code>gray</code> holds only five
characters, and <code>salmon</code> holds only seven.  Since no array size was
explicitly stated, the size is determined by the lengths of the string
literals used to initialize them.

   <p>Also, note that, after initialization, you cannot assign a new string
literal to an array using the assignment operator.  For example, this
will not work:

<pre class="example">     char lemon[26] = "custard";
     
     lemon = "steak sauce";
     </pre>

   <p>However, there are functions in the GNU C library that perform operations
on string arrays.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">A String Length Caution</h4>

<p>It is possible for you to explicitly state the number of elements in the
array, and then initialize it using a string that has more characters than
there are elements in the array.  This is not a good thing.  The larger string
will <em>not</em> override the previously specified size of the array, and you
will get a compile-time warning.  Since the original array size remains, any
part of the string that exceeds that original size is being put into a memory
location that was not allocated for it.

   <p>This same problem occurs regardless of if you initialize the string using
a comma-delimited sequence of characters or a string literal.

<h3 class="section">Declaring Pointers</h3>

<p>You declare a pointer by specifying a name for it and a data type. 
The data type indicates of what type of variable the pointer will
hold memory addresses.

   <p>When you declare a pointer, you must include the indirection
operator (see <a href="#The%20Indirection%20Operator">The Indirection Operator</a>) in between the data type
and the name.  Here is the general form of a pointer declaration:

<pre class="example">     <var>data-type</var> * <var>name</var>;
     </pre>

   <p>More commonly, programmers put the operator either directly next to
<var>name</var>, or directly next <var>data-type</var>, like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>data-type</var> *<var>name</var>;
     <var>data-type</var>* <var>name</var>;
     </pre>

   <p>Any of these three is fine, and they all work the same way.  Here is an
example of declaring a pointer to hold the address of an <code>int</code> variable:

<pre class="example">     int *ip;
     </pre>

   <p>Be careful, though:  you must explicitly declare each pointer as a pointer,
using the indirection operator for each one:

<pre class="example">     int *bob, *emily;  // Two pointers.
     int *rob, laura;   // A pointer and an integer variable.
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="section">Initializing Pointers</h3>

<p>You can initialize a pointer when you first declare it by specifying
a variable address to store in it.  For example, the following code
declares an <code>int</code> variable <code>i</code>, and a pointer which is
initialized with the address of <code>i</code>:

<pre class="example">     int i;
     int *ip = &amp;i;
     </pre>

   <p>Notice the use of the address operator (see <a href="#The%20Address%20Operator">The Address Operator</a>).  You
use that to get the memory address of a variable.  <em>Be careful</em>, though:
after you declare a pointer, you do <em>not</em> use the indirection
operator with the pointer's name when assigning it a new address to point
to.  On the contrary, that would change the value of the variable that
the points to.  For example:

<pre class="example">     int i, j;
     int *ip = &amp;i;    // <code>ip</code> now holds the address of <code>i</code>.
     
     ip = &amp;j;         // <code>ip</code> now holds the address of <code>j</code>.
     
     *ip = &amp;i;        // Now <code>j</code> holds the address of <code>i</code>.
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Defining Structures</h4>

<p>You define a structure using the <code>struct</code> keyword followed by
the declarations of the structure's members, enclosed in
braces.  You declare each member of a structure just as you would
normally declare a variable--using the data type followed by one
or more variable names separated by commas, and ending with a
semicolon.  Then end the structure definition with a semicolon after
the closing brace.

   <p>You should also include a name for the structure in between the
<code>struct</code> keyword and the opening brace.  This is optional, but
if you leave it out, you can't refer to that structure data type
later on.

   <p>Here is an example of defining a simple structure for holding the
X and Y coordinates of a point:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     </pre>

   <p>That defines a structure named <code>point</code>, which contains two
members, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, both of which are of type <code>int</code>.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Declaring Structure Variables at Definition</h5>

<p>You can declare variables of a structure type when you define the
structure type by putting the variable names after the closing
brace of the structure definition, but before the final semicolon. 
You can declare more than one such variable by separating the names
with commas.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       } first_point, second_point;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares two variables of type <code>struct point</code>,
<code>first_point</code> and <code>second_point</code>.

<p>You can declare variables of a structure type after defining the
structure by using the <code>struct</code> keyword and the name you
gave the structure type, followed by one or more variable names
separated by commas.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point, second_point;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares two variables of type <code>struct point</code>,
<code>first_point</code> and <code>second_point</code>.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Initializing Structure Members</h5>

<p>You can initialize the members of a structure type to have certain
values when you declare structure variables.  One way is to specify
the values in a set of braces and separated by commas.  Those values
are assigned to the structure members in the same order that the
members are declared in the structure in definition.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point = { 5, 10 };
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, the <code>x</code> member of <code>first_point</code> gets the
value 5, and the <code>y</code> member gets the value 10.

   <p>Another way to initialize the members is to specify the name of the
member to initialize.  This way, you can initialize the members in
any order you like, and even leave some of them uninitialized.  There
are two methods that you can use--either follow the member name with
a colon, and then its value, like this:

<pre class="example">     struct point first_point = { y: 10, x: 5 };
     </pre>

<p>or precede the member name with a period and assign a value
with the assignment operator, like this:

<pre class="example">     struct point first_point = { .y = 10, .x = 5 };
     </pre>

   <p>You can also initialize the structure variable's members when you declare
the variable during the structure definition:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       } first_point = { 5, 10 };
     </pre>

   <p>You can also initialize less than all of a structure variable's members:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point = { 5 };
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, only one member, <code>x</code>, is initialized.  <code>y</code> is
left uninitialized.  (This is because the members are initialized in
order of declaration, and <code>x</code> was declared before <code>y</code>.)

   <p>Here is another example that initializes a structure's members which
are structure variables themselves:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct rectangle
       {
         struct point top_left, bottom_right;
       };
     
     struct rectangle my_rectangle = { {0, 5}, {10, 0} };
     </pre>

   <p>That example defines the <code>rectangle</code> structure to consist of
two <code>point</code> structure variables.  Then it declares one variable
of type <code>struct rectangle</code> and initializes its members.  Since
its members are structure variables, there is an extra set of braces
surrounding the members that belong to the <code>point</code> structure
variables.  However, those extra braces are not necessary; they just
make the code easier to read.

<h3 class="subsection">Accessing Structure Members</h4>

<p>You can access the members of a structure variable using the member
access operator <code>.</code> .  You put the name of the structure
variable on the left side of the operator, and the name of the
member on the right side.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point;
     
     first_point.x = 0;
     first_point.y = 5;
     </pre>

   <p>You can also access the members of a structure variable which is itself a
member of a structure variable.

<pre class="example">     struct rectangle
       {
         struct point top_left, bottom_right;
       };
     
     struct rectangle my_rectangle;
     
     my_rectangle.top_left.x = 0;
     my_rectangle.top_left.y = 5;
     
     my_rectangle.bottom_right.x = 10;
     my_rectangle.bottom_right.y = 0;
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Arrays of Structures</h4>

<p>You can create an array of a structure type just like you can an array
of a primitive data type.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point point_array [3];
     </pre>

   <p>That example creates a 3-element array of <code>struct point</code>
variables called <code>point_array</code>.  You can also initialize the
elements of a structure array:

<pre class="example">     struct point point_array [3] = { {2, 3}, {4, 5}, {6, 7} };
     </pre>

   <p>As with initializing structures which contain structure members, the
additional inner grouping braces are optional.  But, if you use the
additional braces, then you can partially initialize some of the
structures in the array, and fully initialize others:

<pre class="example">     struct point point_array [3] = { {2}, {4, 5}, {6, 7} };
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, the first element of the array has only its <code>x</code>
member initialized.  Because of the grouping braces, the value 4 is
assigned to the <code>x</code> member of the second array element,
<em>not</em> to the <code>y</code> member of the first element, as would be
the case without the grouping braces.

   <p>After initialization, you can still access the structure members in the
array using the member access operator.  You put the array name and
element number (enclosed in brackets) to the left of the operator, and
the member name to the right.

<pre class="example">     struct point point_array [3];
     
     point_array[0].x = 2;
     point_array[0].y = 3;
     </pre>

<h3 class="subsection">Pointers to Structures</h4>

<p>You can create a pointer to a structure type just like you can a pointer
to a primitive data type.

<pre class="example">     struct fish
       {
         float length, weight;
       };
     
     struct fish salmon = {4.3, 5.8};
     
     struct fish *fish_ptr = &amp;salmon;
     </pre>

   <p>That example creates a new structure type, <code>struct fish</code>, and
declares (and initializes) a variable of that type named <code>salmon</code>. 
Finally, it declares a pointer to the type <code>struct fish</code>, and
gives it the address of <code>salmon</code>.

   <p>You can access the members of a structure variable through a pointer,
but you can't use the regular member access operator anymore.  Instead,
you have to use the indirect member access operator <code>-&gt;</code> .  Continuing
with the previous example, the following example will change the values
of the members of <code>salmon</code>:

<pre class="example">     fish_ptr -&gt; length = 5.1;
     fish_ptr -&gt; weight = 6.2;
     </pre>

   <p>Now the <code>length</code> and <code>width</code> members in <code>salmon</code> are
5.1 and 6.2, respectively.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Bit Fields</h4>

<p>You can create structures with integer members of nonstandard sizes, called
<em>bit fields</em>.  You do this by specifying an integer (<code>int</code>,
<code>char</code>, <code>long int</code>, etc.) member as usual, and inserting a colon
and the number of bits that the member should occupy in between the
member's name and the semicolon.

<pre class="example">     struct card
       {
         unsigned int suit : 2;
         unsigned int face_value : 4;
       };
     </pre>

   <p>That example defines a structure type with two bit fields, <code>suit</code> and
<code>face_value</code>, which take up 2 bits and 4 bits, respectively.  <code>suit</code>
can hold values from 0 to 3, and <code>face_value</code> can hold values from 0 to
15.  Notice that these bit fields were declared as <code>unsigned int</code>; had
they been signed integers, then their ranges would have been from -2 to 1, and
from -8 to 7, respectively.

   <p>More generally, the range of an unsigned bit field of N bits is from
0 to 2^N - 1, and the range of a signed bit field of N bits is from
-(2^N) / 2 to ((2^N) / 2) - 1.

<h3 class="section">Unions</h3>

<p>A union is a custom data type used for storing several variables in the
same memory space.  Although you can access any of those variables at any
time, you should only read from one of them at a time--assigning a value to
one of them overwrites the values in the others.

union type by putting the variable names after the closing
brace of the union definition, but before the final semicolon. 
You can declare more than one such variable by separating the names
with commas.

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       } first_number, second_number;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares two variables of type <code>union numbers</code>,
<code>first_number</code> and <code>second_number</code>.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Declaring Union Variables After Definition</h5>

<p>You can declare variables of a union type after you define the
union by using the <code>union</code> keyword and the name you
gave the union type, followed by one or more variable names
separated by commas.

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     
     union numbers first_number, second_number;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares two variables of type <code>union numbers</code>,
<code>first_number</code> and <code>second_number</code>.

<h3 class="subsubsection">Initializing Union Members</h5>

<p>You can initialize the first member of a union variable when you
declare it:

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     
     union numbers first_number = { 5 };
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, the <code>i</code> member of <code>first_number</code> gets the
value 5.  The <code>f</code> member is left alone.

   <p>Another way to initialize a union member is to specify the name of the
member to initialize.  This way, you can initialize whichever member
you want to, not just the first one.  There are two methods that you can
use--either follow the member name with a colon, and then its value,
like this:

<pre class="example">     union numbers first_number = { f: 3.14159 };
     </pre>

<p>or precede the member name with a period and assign a value
with the assignment operator, like this:

<pre class="example">     union numbers first_number = { .f = 3.14159 };
     </pre>

   <p>You can also initialize a union member when you declare the union
variable during the definition:

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       } first_number = { 5 };
     </pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Accessing Union Members</h4>

<p>You can access the members of a union variable using the member
access operator <code>.</code> .  You put the name of the union
variable on the left side of the operator, and the name of the
member on the right side.

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     
     union numbers first_number;
     
     first_number.i = 5;
     
     first_number.f = 3.9;
     </pre>

   <p>Notice in that example that giving a value to the <code>f</code> member overrides
the value stored in the <code>i</code> member.

<h3 class="subsection">Arrays of Unions</h4>

<p>You can create an array of a union type just like you can an array
of a primitive data type.

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     
     union numbers number_array [3];
     </pre>

   <p>That example creates a 3-element array of <code>union numbers</code>
variables called <code>number_array</code>.  You can also initialize the
first members of the elements of a number array:

<pre class="example">     struct point point_array [3] = { {3}, {4}, {5} };
     </pre>

<p>The additional inner grouping braces are optional.

   <p>After initialization, you can still access the union members in the
array using the member access operator.  You put the array name and
element number (enclosed in brackets) to the left of the operator, and
the member name to the right.

<pre class="example">     union numbers number_array [3];
     
     number_array[0].i = 2;
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Pointers to Unions</h4>

<p>You can create a pointer to a union type just like you can a pointer
to a primitive data type.

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     
     union numbers first_number = {4};
     
     union numbers *number_ptr = &amp;first_number;
     </pre>

   <p>That example creates a new union type, <code>union numbers</code>, and
declares (and initializes the first member of) a variable of that type
named <code>first_number</code>.  Finally, it declares a pointer to the type
<code>union numbers</code>, and gives it the address of <code>first_number</code>.

   <p>You can access the members of a union variable through a pointer,
but you can't use the regular member access operator anymore.  Instead,
you have to use the indirect member access operator <code>-&gt;</code> .  Continuing
with the previous example, the following example will change the value
of the first member of <code>first_number</code>:

<pre class="example">     number_ptr -&gt; i = 450;
     </pre>

   <p>Now the <code>i</code> member in <code>first_number</code> is 450.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Size of Unions</h4>

<p>This size of a union is equal to the size of its largest member.  Consider
the first union example from this section:

<pre class="example">     union numbers
       {
         int i;
         float f;
       };
     </pre>

<p>The size of the union data type is the same as <code>sizeof (float)</code>,
because the <code>float</code> type is larger than the <code>int</code> type.  Since all
of the members of a union occupy the same memory space, the union data type
size doesn't need to be large enough to hold the sum of all their sizes; it
just needs to be large enough to hold the largest member.

<h3 class="section">Enumerations</h3>

<p>An enumeration is a custom data type used for storing constant integer
values and referring to them by names.

Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Enumerations">Enumerations</a>
<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Defining Enumerations</h4>

<p>You define an enumeration using the <code>enum</code> keyword, followed by
the name of the enumeration (this is optional), followed by a list of
constant names (separated by commas and enclosed in braces), and ending
with a semicolon.

<pre class="example">     enum fruit {grape, cherry, lemon, kiwi};
     </pre>

   <p>That example defines an enumeration, <code>fruit</code>, which contains four
constant integer values, <code>grape</code>, <code>cherry</code>, <code>lemon</code>, and
<code>kiwi</code>, whose values are, by default, 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
You can also specify one or more of the values explicitly:

<pre class="example">     enum more_fruit {banana = -17, apple, blueberry, mango};
     </pre>

   <p>That example defines <code>banana</code> to be -17, and the remaining values are
incremented by 1--<code>apple</code> is -16, <code>blueberry</code> is -15, and
<code>mango</code> is -14.  Unless specified otherwise, an enumeration value is
equal to one more than the previous value (and the first value defaults to 0).

   <p>You can also refer to an enumeration value defined earlier in the same
enumeration:

<pre class="example">     enum yet_more_fruit {kumquat, raspberry, peach,
                          plum = peach + 2};
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, <code>kumquat</code> is 0, <code>raspberry</code> is 1,
<code>peach</code> is 2, and <code>plum</code> is 4.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Declaring Enumerations</h4>

<p>You can declare variables of an enumeration type both when the enumeration
is defined and afterward.

<pre class="example">     enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango} my_fruit;
     </pre>

   <p>That example declares one variable of type <code>enum fruit</code>.

<pre class="example">     enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango};
     
     enum fruit my_fruit;
     </pre>

   <p>That example also declares one variable of type <code>enum fruit</code>.  (Of
course, you couldn't declare it that way if you hadn't named the
enumeration.)

   <p>Although such variables are considered to be of an enumeration type, you
can assign them any value that you could assign to an <code>int</code> variable,
including values from other enumerations.  Furthermore, any variable that
can be assigned an <code>int</code> value can be assigned a value from an
enumeration.

   <p>However, you cannot change the values in an enumeration once it has been
defined; they are constant values.  For example, this won't work:

<pre class="example">     enum fruit {banana, apple, blueberry, mango};
     
     banana = 15;  /* You can't do this! */
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">Incomplete Types</h3>

<p>You can define structures, unions, and enumerations without listing their
members (or values, in the case of enumerations).  Doing so results in
an incomplete type.  You can't declare variables of incomplete types, but
you can work with pointers to those types.

<pre class="example">     struct point;
     </pre>

   <p>At some time later in your program you will most likely want to complete
the type.  You do this by defining it as you usually would:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">Expressions</h3>

<p>An <dfn>expression</dfn> consists of at least one operand and zero or more
operators.  The operands may be any value, including constants, variables,
and function calls that return values.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     47
     2 + 2
     function()
     </pre>

<p>The last of those expressions, <code>function()</code>, is only an expression
if <code>function()</code> has a return type other than <code>void</code>.

   <p>You can use parentheses to group subexpressions.

<pre class="example">     ( 2 * ( ( 3 + 10 ) - ( 2 * 6 ) ) )
     </pre>

<p>When you use parentheses, the innermost expressions are evaluated
first.  So, in the above example, <code>3 + 10</code> and <code>2 * 6</code> evaluate to
<code>13</code> and <code>12</code>, respectively.  Then <code>12</code> is subtracted
from <code>13</code>, resulting in <code>1</code>.  Finally, <code>1</code> is multiplied by
<code>2</code>, resulting in <code>2</code>.  The outermost parentheses are completely
optional.

   <p>An <dfn>operator</dfn> specifies an operation to be performed on its operand(s). 
In GNU C, operators may have one, two, or three operands, depending on the
operator.  These are known as unary operators, binary operators, and
ternary operators, respectively.

<h3 class="subsection">The Increment Operator</h4>

<p>The increment operator <code>++</code> adds 1 to its operand.  The operand must
be a either a variable of one of the primitive data types, a pointer, or an
enumeration variable.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     char y = 'B';
     float z = 5.2;
     int *p = &amp;x;
     
     x++;   /* <code>x</code> is now 6. */
     y++;   /* <code>y</code> is now `C'. */
     z++;   /* <code>z</code> is now 6.2. */
     p++;   /* <code>p</code> is now <code>&amp;x</code> + <code>sizeof(int)</code>. */
     </pre>

   <p>You can use the increment operator either before or after the operand--
prefix or postfix, respectively.  A prefix increment adds 1 before the
operand is evaluated.  A postfix increment adds 1 after the operand is
evaluated.  In the previous examples, that wouldn't have made any
difference.  However, there are cases where it does make a difference:

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     
     printf ("%d \n", x++);    /* Print <code>x</code> and then increment it. */
     
     /* <code>x</code> is now equal to 6. */
     
     printf ("%d \n", ++x);    /* Increment <code>x</code> and then print it. */
     </pre>

   <p>The output of the above example is:

<h3 class="subsection">The Decrement Operator</h4>

<p>The decrement operator <code>--</code> subtracts 1 from its operand.  The operand
must be a either a variable of one of the primitive data types, a pointer, or
an enumeration variable.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     char y = 'B';
     float z = 5.2;
     int *p = &amp;x;
     
     x--;   /* <code>x</code> is now 4. */
     y--;   /* <code>y</code> is now `A'. */
     z--;   /* <code>z</code> is now 4.2. */
     p--;   /* <code>p</code> is now <code>&amp;x</code> - <code>sizeof(int)</code>. */
     </pre>

   <p>You can use the decrement operator either before or after the operand--
prefix or postfix, respectively.  A prefix decrement subtracts 1 before the
operand is evaluated.  A postfix increment subtracts 1 after the operand is
evaluated.  In the previous examples, that wouldn't have made any
difference.  However, there are cases where it does make a difference:

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     
     printf ("%d \n", x--);   /* Print <code>x</code> and then decrement it. */
     
     /* x is now 4 */
     
     printf ("%d \n", --x);   /* Decrement <code>x</code> and then print it. */
     </pre>

   <p>The output of the above example is:

<h3 class="subsection">The Positive Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the positive operator <code>+</code> on numeric variables and constants
to indicate that their value is positive.  By default, values are positive
unless explicitly stated to be negative, so there is no need to use the
positive operator.  However, you can use it to visually enforce the fact
that a value is positive.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     int x = +5;
     float y = +3.14159;
     </pre>

     float y = -3.14159;
     </pre>

   <p>If the operand you use with the negative operator is of an unsigned data
type, then the result is not negative, but rather it is the
maximum value of the unsigned data type, minus the value of the operand.

<h3 class="subsection">The Logical Negation Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the logical negation operator <code>!</code> to get the logical
opposite of its operand.  If its operand is 0 (or null if the operand is
a pointer), then the result of the logical negation operator is 1.  If its
operand is anything other than 0 (or null), then the result of the logical
negation operator is 0.  Either way, the result is an integer value.  Here
are some examples:

<pre class="example">     int x = !5;   /* <code>x</code> is 0. */
     
     if (!x)

<h3 class="subsection">The Bitwise Complement Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the bitwise complement operator <code>~</code> to find the one's
complement of its operand.  The operand must be an integer or character type. 
The bitwise complement operator examines its operand's bits, and
changes all 0 bits to 1 and all 1 bits to 0.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     unsigned int x = 500;
     unsigned int y;
     
     y = ~x;
     </pre>

   <p>Using signed data types with the bitwise complement operator may cause
portability problems.  You should use unsigned data types for maximum
portability.

<h3 class="subsection">The Address Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the address operator <code>&amp;</code> to obtain the memory address
of its operand.  You can use this operator both with variables of any data type
(including arrays and structures) and with functions, but you can't
use it with literal values.  You should only store the result of the
address operator in pointer variables.

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     int *ptr;
     
     ptr = &amp;x;
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">The Indirection Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the indirection operator <code>*</code> to obtain the value stored
at the address stored in its operand.  This is also known as
<dfn>dereferencing</dfn> its operand.  Its operand must be a pointer.

<pre class="example">     int x = 5;
     int y;
     int *ptr;
     
     ptr = &amp;x;    /* <code>ptr</code> now holds the address of <code>x</code>. */
     
     y = *ptr;    /* <code>y</code> gets the value stored at the address
                     stored in <code>ptr</code>. */
     </pre>

   <p>Be sure to only use the indirection operator with pointers that have
been initialized.  Otherwise, the value stored in those pointers probably
won't be anything you want to use.

<h3 class="subsection">The Complex Conjugation Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the complex conjugation operator <code>~</code> to perform complex
conjugation on its operand -- that is, it reverses the sign of its
imaginary component.   The operand must be an expression of a complex number
type.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     __complex__ int x = 5 + 17i;
     
     printf ("%d  \n", (x * ~x));
     </pre>

   <p>Since an imaginary number (a + bi) multiplied by its conjugate is equal
to a^2 + b^2, the above <code>printf</code> statement will print 314, which
is equal to 25 + 289.

<h3 class="subsection">The <code>sizeof</code> Operator</h4>

<p>You can use the <code>sizeof</code> operator to obtain the size (in bytes)
of the data type of its operand.  The operand may be an actual type
specifier (such as <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>), as well as any valid
expression.  You must enclose the operand in parentheses after the
operator.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     printf ("%d \n", sizeof (int) );
     printf ("%d \n", sizeof (float) );
     printf ("%d \n", sizeof (5) );
     printf ("%d \n", sizeof (5.1) );
     </pre>

   <p>The result of the <code>sizeof</code> operator is of a type called <code>size_t</code>,
which is defined in the header file <code>stddef.h</code>.  <code>size_t</code> is
an unsigned integer type, perhaps identical to <code>unsigned int</code> or
<code>unsigned long int</code>.  This can vary from system to system.

<h3 class="subsection">Type Casts</h4>

<p>You can use a type cast to explicitly declare the data type of an expression. 
A type cast consists of a type specifier enclosed in parentheses, followed
by an expression.  To ensure proper casting, you should also enclose
the expression that follows the type specifier in parentheses.  Here is
an example:

<pre class="example">     float x;
     int y = 7;
     int z = 3;
     
     x = (float)(y / z);
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, since <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> are both integers, integer
division is performed, and even though <code>x</code> is a floating-point
variable, it receives the value 2.  By explicitly casting the result
of the division to <code>float</code>, the floating-point value 2.333<small class="dots">...</small>
can be retained and assigned to <code>x</code>.

<h3 class="subsection">Array Subscripts</h4>

<p>You can access array elements by specifying the name of the array, and the
array subscript (or index, or element number) enclosed in brackets.  Here is

<h3 class="subsection">The Addition Operator</h4>

<p>You use the addition operator <code>+</code> to add two operands.  You put the
operands on either side of the operator, and it does not matter which operand
is goes on which side:  <code>3 + 5</code> and <code>5 + 3</code> both result in 8. 
The operands must be either expressions of a primitive data type or pointers.

<pre class="example">     x = 5 + 3;
     y = 10 + 37;
     z = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5;
     </pre>

   <p>When you use more than one addition operator (and more than two operands),
such as in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

<p>You use the subtraction operator <code>-</code> to subtract its second operand
from its first operand.  You put the operands on either side of the operator,
and it does matter which operand goes on which side:  <code>3 - 5</code> and
<code>5 - 3</code> do not both have the same result.  The operands must be either

<h3 class="subsection">The Modulus Operator</h4>

<p>You use the modulus operator <code>%</code> to obtain the remainder produced
by dividing its two operands.  You put the operands on either side of
the operator, and it does matter which operand goes on which
side:  <code>3 % 5</code> and <code>5 \% 3</code> do not both have the same result. 
The operands must be expressions of a primitive data type.

<pre class="example">     x = 5 % 3;
     y = 74 % 47;
     z = 47 % 32 % 21;
     </pre>

   <p>When you use more than one modulus operator (and more than two operands),
like in the last example, the expression is evaluated from left to right.

   <p>A common application of the modulus operator is to determine if one
number is divisible by another number.  If it is divisible, then the
remainder is zero.  Here is an example of that:

<pre class="example">     int counter;
     
     for( counter = 0; counter &lt;= 100; counter++ )
       {
         if( counter % 5 == 0 )
           printf("%d\n", counter);
       }
     </pre>

   <p>That prints all of the integers from 0 to 100 that are divisible by 5.

<h3 class="subsection">The Shift Operators</h4>

<p>You use the left-shift operator <code>&lt;&lt;</code> to shift its first operand's bits
to the left.  You specify the number of bit-places shifted with the second
operand.  If there is a 1 bit in the leftmost bit position, it will be
discarded.  New bits that are added to the rightmost bit position will all
be 0.

<pre class="example">     
     x = 47;    /* 47 is 00101111 in binary. */
     
     x &lt;&lt; 1;    /* 00101111 &lt;&lt; 1 is 01011110. */
     </pre>

   <p>You use the right-shift operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to shift its first operand's bits
to the right.  You specify the number of bit-places shifted with the second
operand.  If there is a 1 bit in the rightmost bit position, it will be
discarded.  New bits that are added to the leftmost bit position
may be either 0 or 1.  If the first operand is unsigned, then the added
bits will be 0.  If it is signed, the added bits will be either 0 <em>or</em>
whatever value was previously in the leftmost bit position.

<pre class="example">     x = 47;   /* 47 is 00101111 in binary. */

<h3 class="subsection">The Bitwise AND Operator</h4>

<p>The bitwise AND operator <code>&amp;</code> examines each bit in its two
operands, and when two corresponding bits are both 1, the resulting bit
is 1.  In every other case the result is 0.  Here is an example of
how this operator works, using binary numbers:

<pre class="example">     11001001 &amp; 10011011 = 10001001
     </pre>

   <p>If you look closely at that, you'll see that when a bit is 1
in both operands, the corresponding bit in the result is set to 1. 
Otherwise it is set to 0.  Here is another example, this time in C:

     z = x &amp; y;

respectively.

<h3 class="subsubsection">The Not-Equal-to Operator</h5>

<p>Use the not-equal-to operator <code>!=</code> to test two operands for
inequality.  If the two operands are not equal, the result is 1.  Otherwise,
if the two operands <em>are</em> equal, the result is 0.

<h3 class="subsection">Logical Operators</h4>

<p>You can use the logical operators to test the truth value of two

or pointers.

   <p>Note that while the comparison operators return the value 1 for a true
expression, any nonzero expression is considered true in C.

<h3 class="subsubsection">The Logical AND Operator</h5>

<p>Use the logical AND operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to test if two expressions are
both true.  If the first one is not true, then the second one is not
evaluated.

<pre class="example">     if ((x == 5) &amp;&amp; (y == 10))
       printf ("x is 5 and y is 10");
     </pre>

   <p>You can also build an expression using more than one AND operator,
and more than two operands, like this:

<pre class="example">     if ((x == 5) &amp;&amp; (y == 10) &amp;&amp; (z == 15))

<p>You use the assignment operators to give values to variables.  Regardless
of which assignment operator is being used, the first operand -- the

Except as noted, the operands must be of a primitive data type, or a
pointer.

to primitive types and pointers.

<h3 class="subsubsection">The Compound Assignment Operators</h5>

<p>You use the compound assignment operators to perform an operation on
both the left and right operands, and then assign the resulting
expression to the left operand.  Here is a list of the compound
assignment operators, and a brief description of what they do:

     <ul>

     <li><code>+=</code>

     <p>This operator adds its two operands together, and then assigns the result of
the addition to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>-=</code>

     <p>This operator subtracts its right operand from its left operand, and
assigns the result of the subtraction to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>*=</code>

     <p>This operator multiplies its two operands together, and then assigns the
result of the multiplication to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>/=</code>

     <p>This operator divides its left operand by its right operand, and assigns
the result of the division to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>%=</code>

     <p>This operator performs modular division on its operands, and assigns the
result of the division to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>&lt;&lt;=</code>

     <p>This operator performs a left shift operation on its left operand, shifting
by the number of bits specified by the right operand, and assigns the
result of the shift to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>&gt;&gt;=</code>

     <p>This operator performs a right shift operation on its left operand,
shifting by the number of bits specified by the right operand, and assigns
the result of the shift to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>&amp;=</code>

     <p>This operator performs a bitwise AND operation on its two operands, and
assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>^=</code>

     <p>This operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on its two operands,
and assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

     </p><li><code>|=</code>

     <p>This operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation on its two
operands, and assigns the result of the operation to the left operand.

   </ul>

   <p>Here is an example of using one of the compound assignment operators:

<pre class="example">     x += y;
     </pre>

<p>That produces the same result as:

<pre class="example">     x = x + y;
     </pre>

</div>

<h3 class="subsubsection">Generalized Lvalues</h5>

<p>Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.

   <p>For example, you can assign a value to a compound expression, provided the
last expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a, b) += 5
     a, (b += 5)
     </pre>

   <p>Similarly, you can take the address of a compound expression.  So, these two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     &amp;(a, b)
     a, &amp;b
     </pre>

   <p>A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and if
both the second and third operands are valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a ? b : c) = 5
     (a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
     </pre>

   <p>A type cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <code>a</code> has type <code>char *</code>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a = 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
     </pre>

   <p>An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <code>+=</code> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a += 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
     </pre>

   <p>You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <code>&amp;(int)f</code> were
permitted, where <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:

<pre class="example">     *&amp;(int)f = 1;
     </pre>

   <p>This is quite different from what <code>(int)f = 1</code> would do--that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <code>&amp;</code> on a cast.

   <p>If you really do want an <code>int *</code> pointer with the address of
<code>f</code>, you can simply write <code>(int *)&amp;f</code>.

<h3 class="subsection">The Comma Operator</h4>

<p>You use the comma operator <code>,</code> to separate two expressions.  These
expressions don't have to be related at all, but often the first expression
produces a value that is used by the second expression.

<pre class="example">     int x = 5, y = 10;
     
     x++, y = x * x;
     </pre>

   <p>More commonly, the comma operator is used in <code>for</code> statements, like
this:

<pre class="example">     /* Using the comma operator in a <code>for</code> statement. */
     
     for (x = 1, y = 10;  x &lt;=10 &amp;&amp; y &gt;=1;  x++, y--)
       {
         ...
       }
     </pre>

   <p>A comma is also used to separate function parameters; however, this
is <em>not</em> the comma operator in action.   In fact, if the comma
operator is used as we have discussed here in a function call (without
enclosing it in an additional set of parentheses), then the compiler will
interpret that as calling the function with an extra parameter.

<pre class="example">     function (x,  y=47, y,  z);
     </pre>

   <p>Even though what may be intended by such a function call is to
call the function with the parameters <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and
<code>z</code>, with <code>y</code> set to 47, what will happen is that the
function will be called with the parameters <code>x</code>, <code>y=47</code>,
<code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.  So if you want to include expressions that
use the comma operator in a function call, surround the comma operator
expression with parentheses.

<pre class="example">     function (x,  (y=47, y),  z);
     </pre>

   <p>That will call <code>function</code> with the parameters <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, with <code>y</code> set to 47.

</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Member Access Operators</h4>

<p>You can use the member access operator <code>.</code> to access the members
of a structure or union variable.  You put the name of the structure
variable on the left side of the operator, and the name of the
member on the right side.

<pre class="example">     struct point
     {
       int x, y;
     };
     
     struct point first_point;
     
     first_point.x = 0;
     first_point.y = 5;
     </pre>

   <p>You can also access the members of a structure or union variable via
a pointer by using the indirect member access operator <code>-&gt;</code>.

<pre class="example">     struct fish
       {
         int length, weight;
       };
     
     struct fish salmon;
     
     struct fish *fish_pointer = &amp;salmon;
     
     fish_pointer -&gt; length = 3;
     fish_pointer -&gt; weight = 9;

<h3 class="section">The Ternary Operator</h3>

<p>GNU C has only one ternary operator -- the conditional operator <code>? :</code>.

   <p>You use the conditional operator to cause the entire conditional
expression to evaluate to either its second or its third operand, based
on the truth value of its first operand.

   <p>Put the first operand is before the question mark; this operand
may be any expression.  If it evaluates to true (nonzero), then
the second operand (which is also an expression), which is placed
in between the question mark and the colon, is evaluated, and
becomes the value of the conditional expression.  Otherwise, the third
operand (also an expression), which is placed after the colon, is
evaluated, and becomes the value of the conditional expression.  Here
is an example

<pre class="example">     a = (x == 5) ? y : z;
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, if <code>x</code> equals 5, then <code>a</code> will receive
the value <code>y</code>.  Otherwise, <code>a</code> will receive the value
<code>z</code>.  Really, this is a shorthand method for writing a simple
<code>if</code><small class="dots">...</small><code>else</code> statement.  The previous example will
accomplish the same task as the following example:

<pre class="example">     if( x != 0)
         a = y;
     else
         a = z;
     </pre>

   <p>If the first operand of the conditional operator is true, then the third
operand is never evaluated.  Similarly, if the first operand is false,
then the second operand is never evaluated.  The first operand is always
evaluated.

   <p>You can also leave out the second operand -- this is similar to using the
first operand as both the first operand <em>and</em> the second operand.  For
example, the expression

<pre class="example">     x ? : y
     </pre>

<p>has the same value as

<pre class="example">     x ? x : y
     </pre>

   <p>In simple examples like that one, there is no point to leaving out the
second operand.  However, if the first operand had a side effect, such
as incrementing a variable, then you might not want that side effect to
happen twice, so you shouldn't include it as both the first and second
operands.

<h3 class="section">Statements and Declarations in Expressions</h3>

<p>A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.

   <p>Recall that a compound statement (also known as a block) is a sequence of
statements surrounded by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around
the braces.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     ({ int y = function (); int z;
        if (y &gt; 0) z = y;
        else z = - y;
        z; })
     </pre>

   <p>That is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <code>function ()</code>.

   <p>The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <code>void</code>, and thus
effectively no value.)

   <p>This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions "safe" (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
"maximum" function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

<pre class="example">     #define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
     </pre>

<p>But this definition computes either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <code>int</code>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:

<pre class="example">     #define maxint(a,b) \
       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
     </pre>

   <p>Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit field, or
the initial value of a static variable.

   <p>If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <code>typeof</code> expressions or type naming.

<h3 class="section">Order of Evaluation</h3>

<p>When an expression consists of subexpressions, such as
<code>a + b * f()</code>, the subexpressions are not all evaluated at once,
nor are they necessarily evaluated left to right as they appear in the
expression.  In the preceding example, for instance, the function call
<code>f()</code> will be evaluated first, the result of which will be multiplied
by <code>b</code>, the result of which will be added to <code>a</code>.  That is not
intuitive simply by looking at the expression, but there is a definite
order in which subexpressions are evaluated.

   <p>The following is a list of types of expressions, presented in the same
order that they are evaluated.  The expressions that are evaluated first
are said to have the highest precedence, and those that are evaluated last
the low precedence.  Some types of expressions have the same precedence. 
If two or more subexpressions have the same precedence, then they
are usually evaluated left to right.  If they are <em>not</em> evaluated
left to right, then that is explicitly stated in the list.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Function calls, array subscripting, and membership access operator
expressions.

     <li>Logical negation, bitwise complement, increment, decrement, unary positive,
unary negative, indirection operator, address operator, type casting, and
<code>sizeof</code> expressions.  When used as subexpressions, these are evaluated

<h3 class="section">Expression Statements</h3>

<p>You can turn any expression into a statement by adding a semicolon to
the end of the expression.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     5;
     2 + 2;
     10 &gt;= 9;
     </pre>

   <p>In each of those, all that happens is that each expression is
evaluated.  However, they are useless because they do not store
a value anywhere, nor do they actually do anything, other than
the evaluation itself.  The compiler is free to ignore such
statements.

   <p>Expression statements are only useful when they have some kind
of side effect, such as storing a value, calling a function, or
(this is esoteric) causing a fault in the program.  Here are
some more useful examples:

<pre class="example">     x++;
     y = x + 25;
     printf ("Hello, user!");
     *cucumber;
     </pre>

   <p>The last of those statements, <code>*cucumber;</code>, could potentially
cause a fault in the program if the value of <code>cucumber</code> is both
not a valid pointer and has been declared as <code>volatile</code>.

<h3 class="section">Labels</h3>

<p>You can use labels to identify a section of source code.  A label
consists of an identifier (such as those used for variable names)
followed by a colon.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     treet:
     </pre>

   <p>You should be aware that label names do not interfere with other
identifier names:

<pre class="example">     int treet = 5;    /* <code>treet</code> the variable. */
     
     treet:            /* <code>treet</code> the label. */
     </pre>

   <p>ISO C mandates that a label must be followed by at least one statement. 
Although GCC will compile code that does not meet this requirement (and
issue a warning in the process), you might want to avoid writing such
code.

<h3 class="section">The <code>if</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>if</code> statement to conditionally execute a section
of your program, based on the truth value of a given expression.

   <p>You can use the <code>if</code> statement to conditionally execute part of your
program, based on the truth value of a given expression.  Here is the
general form of an <code>if</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     if (<var>test</var>)
       <var>then-statement</var>
     else
       <var>else-statement</var>
     </pre>

   <p>If <var>test</var> evaluates to true, then <var>then-statement</var> is executed and
<var>else-statement</var> is not.  If <var>test</var> evaluates to false, then
<var>else-statement</var> is executed and <var>then-statement</var> is not.  The
<code>else</code> clause is optional.

   <p>Here is an actual example:

<pre class="example">     if (x == 10)
       printf ("x is 10");
     </pre>

   <p>If <code>x == 10</code> evaluates to true, then the statement
<code>printf("x is 10");</code> is executed.  If <code>x == 10</code> evaluates to
false, then the statement <code>printf ("x is 10");</code> is not executed.

   <p>Here is an example using <code>else</code>:

<pre class="example">     if (x == 10)
       printf("x is 10");
     else
       printf("x is not 10");
     </pre>

   <p>You can use a series of <code>if</code> statements to test for multiple
conditions:

<pre class="example">     if (x == 1)
       printf ("x is 1");
     else if (x == 2)
       printf ("x is 2");
     else if (x == 3)
       printf ("x is 3");
     else
       printf ("x is something else");
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">The <code>switch</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>switch</code> statement to compare one expression with others,
and then execute a series of sub-statements based on the result of the
comparisons.  Here is the general form of a <code>switch</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     switch(<var>test</var>)
       {
         case <var>compare-1</var>:
           <var>if-equal-statement-1</var>
         case <var>compare-2</var>:
           <var>if-equal-statement-2</var>
         ...
         default:
           <var>default-statement</var>
       }
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>switch</code> statement compares <var>test</var> to each of the
cases of <var>compare</var> expressions, until it finds one that is
equal to <var>test</var>.  Then, the statements following the successful
case are executed.

   <p>Optionally, you can specify a default case.  If <var>test</var> doesn't match
any of the specific cases listed prior to the default case, then
the statements for the default case are executed.  Traditionally, the
default case goes after the specific cases, but that isn't required.

<pre class="example">     switch (x)
       {
         case 0:
           printf ("x is 0");
           break;
         case 1:
           printf ("x is 1");
           break;
         default:
           printf ("x is something else");
           break;
       }
     </pre>

   <p>Notice the usage of the <code>break</code> statement in each of the cases.  This
is because, once a matching case is found, not only are its statements
executed, but so are the statements for all following cases:

<pre class="example">     int x = 0;
     
     switch (x)
       {
         case 0:
           printf ("x is 0");
         case 1:
           printf ("x is 1");
         default:
           printf ("x is something else");
       }
     </pre>

<p>The output of that example is:

<pre class="example">     x is 0
     x is 1
     x is something else
     </pre>

   <p>This is not always desired.  Including a <code>break</code> statement at the
end of each case redirects program flow to after the <code>switch</code> statement.

   <p>You can also specify a range of consecutive integer values in a single
<code>case</code> label, like this:

<pre class="example">     case <var>low</var> ... <var>high</var>:
     </pre>

<p>This has the same effect as the corresponding number of individual <code>case</code>
labels, one for each integer value from <var>low</var> to <var>high</var>, inclusive.

   <p>This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:

<pre class="example">     case 'A' ... 'Z':
     </pre>

   <p><strong>Be careful:</strong> Include spaces around the <code>...</code>; otherwise it
may be parsed incorrectly when you use it with integer values.  For
example, write this:

<pre class="example">     case 1 ... 5:
     </pre>

<p>instead of this:

<pre class="example">     case 1...5:
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">The <code>while</code> Statement</h3>

<p>The <code>while</code> statement is a loop statement with an exit test at
the beginning of the loop.  Here is the general form of the <code>while</code>
statement:

<pre class="example">     while (<var>test</var>)
       <var>statement</var>
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>while</code> statement first evaluates <var>test</var>.  If <var>test</var>
evaluates to true, <var>statement</var> is executed, and then <var>test</var> is
evaluated again.  <var>statement</var> continues to execute repeatedly as long as
<var>test</var> is true after each execution of <var>statement</var>.

<pre class="example">     int counter = 0;
     
     while (counter &lt; 10)
       printf ("%d ", counter++);

       <var>statement</var>
     while (<var>test</var>);
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>do</code> statement first executes <var>statement</var> once.  After that,
it evaluates <var>test</var>.  If <var>test</var> is true, then <var>statement</var> is
executed again.  <var>statement</var> continues to execute repeatedly as long as
<var>test</var> is true after each execution of <var>statement</var>.

<h3 class="section">The <code>for</code> Statement</h3>

<p>The <code>for</code> statement is a loop statement whose structure allows
easy variable initialization, expression testing, and variable
modification.  It is very convenient for making counter-controlled
loops.  Here is the general form of the <code>for</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     for (<var>initialize</var>; <var>test</var>; <var>step</var>)
       <var>statement</var>;
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>for</code> statement first evaluates the expression <var>initialize</var>. 
Then it evaluates the expression <var>test</var>.  If <var>test</var> is false, then
the loop ends and program control resumes after <var>statement</var>.  Otherwise,
if <var>test</var> is true, then <var>statement</var> is executed.  Finally,
<var>step</var> is evaluated, and the next iteration of the loop begins with
evaluating <var>test</var> again.

   <p>Most often, <var>initialize</var> assigns values to one or more variables,
which are generally used as counters,  <var>test</var> compares those
variables to a predefined expression, and <var>step</var> modifies those
variables' values.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     int x;
     
     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x++)
       printf ("%d ", x);
     </pre>

   <p>This example prints the integers from 1 to 10, inclusive.  First, it evaluates
<var>initialize</var>, which assigns <code>x</code> the value 1.  Then, as long as
<code>x</code> is less than or equal to 10, the value of <code>x</code> is printed and
incremented.

   <p>All three of the expressions in a <code>for</code> statement are optional, and any
combination of the three is valid.  Since the first expression is evaluated
only once, it is perhaps the most commonly omitted expression.  You could
also write the above example as:

<pre class="example">     int x = 1;
     
     for (; x &lt;= 10; x++)
       printf ("%d ", x);
     </pre>

<p>In this example, <code>x</code> receives its value prior to the beginning of the
<code>for</code> statement.

   <p>If you leave out the <var>test</var> expression, then the <code>for</code> statement
is an infinite loop (unless you put a <code>break</code> or <code>goto</code> statement
somewhere in <var>statement</var>).  This is like using <code>1</code> as
<var>test</var>; it is never false.

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1; ; x++)
       printf ("%d ", x);
     </pre>

<p>This <code>for</code> statement starts printing numbers at 1 and then
continues indefinitely, always printing <code>x</code> incremented by 1.

   <p>If you leave out the <var>step</var> expression, then no progress is made
toward completing the loop--at least not as is normally expected with
a <code>for</code> statement.

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10;)
       printf ("%d ", x);
     </pre>

<p>This example prints 1 over and over, indefinitely.

   <p>You can use the comma operator for monitoring and modifying multiple
variables in a <code>for</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1, y = 10; x &lt;= 10, y &gt;= 1; x++, y--)
       printf ("%d %d ", x, y);
     </pre>

   <p>This example assigns values to both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, checks that
<code>x</code> is less than or equal to 10 and that <code>y</code> is greater
than or equal to 1, and increments <code>x</code> and decrements <code>y</code>.

<h3 class="section">Blocks</h3>

<p>A <dfn>block</dfn> is a set of zero or more statements enclosed in
braces.  Often, a block is used as the body of an <code>if</code>
statement or a loop statement, to group together statements
that should all be treated as the body of an <code>if</code> or
loop statement.

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x++)
       {
         printf("x is %d\n", x);
     
         if ((x % 2) == 0)
           printf ("%d is even\n", x);
         else
           printf ("%d is odd\n", x);
       }
     </pre>

   <p>You can also put blocks inside other blocks:

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x++)
       {
         if ((x % 2) == 0)
           {
             printf ("x is %d\n", x);
             printf ("%d is even\n", x);
           }
         else
           {
             printf ("x is %d\n", x);
             printf ("%d is odd\n", x);
           }
       }
     </pre>

   <p>You can declare variables inside a block; such variables are local to
that block.

<pre class="example">     {
       int x = 5;
       printf ("%d", x);
     }
     printf ("%d", x);   /* You can't do this! <code>x</code> exists only
                            in the preceding block. */

<h3 class="section">The Null Statement</h3>

<p>The <dfn>null statement</dfn> is merely a semicolon alone.

<pre class="example">     ;
     </pre>

   <p>A null statement does not do anything.  It does not store a value anywhere. 
It does not cause time to pass during the execution of your program.  It
does not find new prime numbers, nor does it invent new low-calorie
sugar substitutes.

   <p>Most often, a null statement is used as the body of
a loop statement, or as one or more of the expressions in a <code>for</code>
statement.  Here is an example of a <code>for</code> statement that uses the
null statement as the body of the loop (and also calculates the integer
square root of <code>n</code>, just for fun):

<pre class="example">     for (i = 1; i*i &lt; n; i++)
       ;
     </pre>

   <p>Here is another example that uses the null statement as the body
of a <code>for</code> loop and also produces output:

<pre class="example">     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 5; printf ("x is now %d\n", x), x++)
       ;
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">The <code>goto</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>goto</code> statement to unconditionally jump to a different
place in the program.  Here is the general form of a <code>goto</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     goto <var>label</var>;
     </pre>

   <p>You have to specify a label to jump to; when the <code>goto</code> statement
is executed, program control jumps to that label.  See <a href="#Labels">Labels</a>.  Here
is an example:

<pre class="example">     goto end_of_program;
     ...
     end_of_program:
     </pre>

   <p>The label can be anywhere in the same function as the <code>goto</code>
statement that jumps to it, but a <code>goto</code> statement cannot jump to a
label in a different function.

   <p>You <em>can</em> use <code>goto</code> statements to simulate loop statements,
but we do not recommend it--it makes the program harder to read, and GCC
cannot optimize it as well.  You should use <code>for</code>,
<code>while</code>, and <code>do</code> statements instead of <code>goto</code> statements,
when possible.

<h3 class="section">The <code>break</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>break</code> statement to terminate a <code>while</code>, <code>do</code>,
<code>for</code>, or <code>switch</code> statement.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     int x;
     
     for (x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x++)
       {
         if (x == 8)
           break;
         else
           printf ("%d ", x);
       }
     </pre>

   <p>That example prints numbers from 1 to 7.  When <code>x</code> is incremented
to 8, <code>x == 8</code> is true, so the <code>break</code> statement is executed,
terminating the <code>for</code> loop prematurely.

   <p>If you put a <code>break</code> statement inside of a loop or <code>switch</code>
statement which itself is inside of a loop or <code>switch</code> statement, then
<code>break</code> only terminates the innermost loop or <code>switch</code> statement.

<h3 class="section">The <code>continue</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>continue</code> statement in loops to terminate an
iteration of the loop and begin the next iteration.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="example">     for (x = 0; x &lt; 100; x++)
     {
       if (x % 2 == 0)
       {
         continue;
       }
       else
       {
         sum_of_odd_numbers + = x;
       }
     }
     </pre>

   <p>If you put a <code>continue</code> statement inside a loop which itself is
inside a loop, then it affects only the innermost loop.

<h3 class="section">The <code>return</code> Statement</h3>

<p>You can use the <code>return</code> statement to end the execution of a function
and return program control to the function that called it.  Here is the
general form of the <code>return</code> statement:

<pre class="example">     return <var>return-value</var>;
     </pre>

   <p><var>return-value</var> is an optional expression to return.  If the
function's return type is <code>void</code>, then it is invalid to return
an expression.  You can, however, use the <code>return</code> statement
without a return value.

   <p>If the function's return type is not the same as the type of
<var>return-value</var>, and automatic type conversion cannot be performed,
then returning <var>return-value</var> is invalid.

   <p>If the function's return type is not <code>void</code> and no return value
is specified, then the <code>return</code> statement is valid unless the
function is called in a context that requires a return value.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     x = cosine (y);
     </pre>

   <p>In that case, the function <code>cosine</code> was called in a context that
required a return value, so the value could be assigned to <code>x</code>.

   <p>Even in contexts where a return value is not required, it is a bad idea
for a non-<code>void</code> function to omit the return value.  With GCC, you
can use the command line option <code>-Wreturn-type</code> to issue a warning
if you omit the return value in such functions.

   <p>Here are some examples of using the <code>return</code> statement, in both
a <code>void</code> and non-<code>void</code> function:

<pre class="example">     void
     print_plus_five (int x)
     {
       printf ("%d ", x + 5);
       return;
     }
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     int
     square_value (int x)
     {
       return x * x;
     }
     </pre>

<h2 class="chapter">Functions</h2>

<p>You can write functions to separate parts of your program into distinct
procedures.  To write a function, you must at least create a function
definition.  It is a good idea also to have an explicit function
declaration; you don't have to, but if you leave it out, then the
implicit declaration might not match the function itself, and you will
get some compile-time warnings.

   <p>Every program requires at least one function, called <code>main</code>. 
That is where the program's execution begins.

<h3 class="section">Function Declarations</h3>

<p>You write a function declaration to specify the name of a function
and its return type.  A function declaration ends with a semicolon.  Here is
the general form:

<pre class="example">     <var>return-type</var> <var>function-name</var> ( );
     </pre>

   <p><var>return-type</var> can be any of the primitive data
types (see <a href="#Data%20Types">Data Types</a>), a structure type (see <a href="#Structures">Structures</a>),
a union type (see <a href="#Unions">Unions</a>), an enumeration type (see <a href="#Enumerations">Enumerations</a>),
a pointer type (see <a href="#Pointers">Pointers</a>), or <code>void</code>.  A return type of
<code>void</code> indicates that the function does not return a value at all.

   <p><var>function-name</var> can be any valid identifier (see <a href="#Identifiers">Identifiers</a>).

   <p>Here is an example of a function declaration for a function named
<code>double_value</code> which has a return type of <code>int</code>:

<pre class="example">     int double_value ( );
     </pre>

   <p>You should write the function declaration above the definition or first use of
the function.  You can put it in a header file and use the <code>#include</code>
directive to include that function declartion in any source code files that
use the function.

<h3 class="section">Function Prototypes</h3>

<p>A function prototype is a function declaration with a list of the function
parameters.  Here is the general form:

<pre class="example">     <var>return-type</var> <var>function-name</var> (<var>parameter-list</var>);
     </pre>

   <p><var>parameter-list</var> consists of zero or more parameters, separated by commas. 
Usually, each parameter consists of a data type, and optionally a name for the
parameter.  The data type can be any of the primitive data
types (see <a href="#Data%20Types">Data Types</a>), a structure type (see <a href="#Structures">Structures</a>),
a union type (see <a href="#Unions">Unions</a>), an enumeration type (see <a href="#Enumerations">Enumerations</a>),
an array type (see <a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>), or a pointer type (see <a href="#Pointers">Pointers</a>).  You
can also specify that a function have a variable number of parameters
(see <a href="#Variable%20Length%20Parameter%20Lists">Variable Length Parameter Lists</a>), or no parameters.  If it has no
parameters, either use <code>void</code> for the parameter list, or do not have a
parameter list at all.

   <p><var>return-type</var> and <var>function-name</var> are described in the function
declaration section.  See <a href="#Function%20Declarations">Function Declarations</a>.

   <p>Here is an example of a function prototype with two parameters:

<pre class="example">     int add_values (int, int);
     </pre>

   <p>If you include a name for a parameter, the name immediately follows the
data type, like this:

<pre class="example">     int add_values (int x, int y);
     </pre>

   <p>The parameter names can be any identifier (see <a href="#Identifiers">Identifiers</a>), and if you
have more than one parameter, you can't use the same name more than
once within a single prototype.

   <p>You should write the function prototype above the definition or first use of
the function.  You can put it in a header file and use the <code>#include</code>
directive to include that function prototype in any source code files that
use the function.

<br>

<h3 class="section">Function Definitions</h3>

<p>You write a function definition to specify what a function
actually does.  A function definition consists of information regarding
the function's name, return type, and types and names of parameters, along
with the body of the function.  The function body is a series of statements
enclosed in braces.  Here is the general form of a function definition:

<pre class="example">     <var>return-type</var>
     <var>function-name</var> (<var>parameter-list</var>)
     {
       <var>function-body</var>
     }
     </pre>

   <p><var>return-type</var> and <var>function-name</var> are described in the section
about function declarations (see <a href="#Function%20Declarations">Function Declarations</a>), and you
should use the same return types and function names in a function
definition that you used in that function's declaration or prototype.

   <p><var>parameter-list</var> is similar to the parameter list described in
the function prototype section (see <a href="#Function%20Prototypes">Function Prototypes</a>), except you
<em>must</em> include names for the parameters in a function definition.

   <p>Here is an simple example of a function definition--it takes two integers as
its parameters and returns the sum of them as its return value:

<pre class="example">     int
     add_values (int x, int y)
     {
       return x + y;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>You can also specify the type of the function parameters on the <em>after</em>
the closing parentheses of the parameter list, like this:

<pre class="example">     int
     add_values (x, y)
                 int x, int y;
     {
       return x + y;
     }
     </pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Calling Functions</h3>

<p>You can call a function by using its name and supplying any needed parameters. 
Here is the general form of a function call:

<pre class="example">     <var>function-name</var> (<var>parameters</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>A function call can make up an entire statement, or it can be used as a
subexpression.  Here is an example of the former case:

<pre class="example">     print_integer ( 5 );
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, the function <code>print_integer</code> is called with the
parameter <code>5</code>.  We can suppose that this function prints out the
value 5 in some way, perhaps to the terminal.

   <p>Here is an example of a function call used as a subexpression; the
function <code>square_value</code> returns the square of its parameter:

<pre class="example">     a = square_integer ( 5 );
     </pre>

   <p>Supposing that the function <code>square_integer</code> works correctly, the
above example assigns the value 25 to <code>a</code>.

   <p>If a function takes more than one parameter, then when you call it, you must
separate parameters with commas.  Here is an example, using a function
that returns the sum of its two parameters:

<pre class="example">     a = sum_of_integers ( 5, 10 );
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">Function Parameters</h3>

<p>Function parameters can either be a constant value or a copy of variable, or
the address of a variable.  When you send a copy of a variable, you cannot
change the original variable that was used as the parameter, only the copy. 
However, when you send the address of a variable, then you can manipulate
the original variable using pointers.

   <p>This section describes both of those situations, and also how to write
functions with variable length parameter lists--a function with an
indefinite number of parameters.

<h3 class="subsection">Pass By Value Parameters</h4>

<p>There are two different situations in which a parameter is considered to
be "passed by value":

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>When you pass a literal or some other constant value to a function.

     <li>When you pass a non-pointer variable to a function.
        </ol>

   <p>In both of these cases, the function cannot modify the original value or
variable that is passed to it.  Of course, constant values cannot be
modified at all, and when a variable is passed to a function, a copy of
that variable is made.  The function then operates on the copy.  Here is
an example:

<pre class="example">     int x = 23;
     
     double_value ( x );
     
     ...
     
     /* Definition for <code>double_value</code>. */
     
     int double_value (int a)
     {
       a = 2 * a;
       return a;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>In that example, even though the parameter <code>a</code> is modified in the
function <code>double_value</code>, the variable <code>x</code> that is passed to
the function does not change.  For the call to <code>double_value</code>
to actually double the value of <code>x</code>, it would have to be incorporated
into an assignment statement, like this:

<pre class="example">     x = double_value ( x );
     </pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Pass By Reference Parameters</h4>

<p>You can pass a value to a function "by reference", which means that, instead
of sending a literal value or a copy of a variable, you send the address of
a variable.  This allows you to change the value of the variable from the
function, which is something you cannot do when the parameter is passed by
value.

   <p>To do this, you specify in the function definition (and prototype, if you use
one) that the parameter is a pointer, like this:

<pre class="example">     void swap_integers (int *a, int *b);
     </pre>

   <p>That example has two parameters, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, both of which are
pointers to <code>int</code> values.  When you call this function, instead of
passing it literal values or variables, you pass it the addresses of
variables, like this:

<pre class="example">     int x = 5, y = 10;
     
     swap_integers ( &amp;x, &amp;y );
     </pre>

   <p>That way, in the function definition, you can actually change the values of
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, because you passed the function the addresses of
those variables.  Here is the definition of the <code>swap_integers</code> function,
which swaps the values held in two integer variables:

<pre class="example">     void
     swap_integers (int *a, int *b)
     {
       int temp;
     
       temp = *a;
       *a = *b;
       *b = temp;
       return;
     }
     </pre>

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="subsection">Variable Length Parameter Lists</h4>

<p>You can write a function that takes a variable number of arguments.  To
do this, the function needs to have at least one parameter of a known
data type, but the remaining parameters are optional, and can vary in both
quantity and data type.

   <p>You list the first parameter as normal, but then as the second parameter,
use an ellipsis: <code>...</code>.  Here is an example function prototype:

<pre class="example">     int add_multiple_values (int number, ...);
     </pre>

   <p>To work with the optional parameters in the function definition, you need
to use macro functions that are defined in the libary header file
<code>stdarg.h</code>.  So be sure to <code>include</code> that file.  Those functions
are described in <cite>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite>, but here is
an example of using them:

<pre class="example">     int
     add_multiple_values (int number, ...)
     {
       int counter, total = 0;
     
       /* Declare a variable of type <code>va_list</code>. */
       va_list parameters;
     
       /* Call the <code>va_start</code> function. */
       va_start (parameters, number);
     
       for (counter = 0; counter &lt; number; counter++)
         {
           /* Get the values of the optional parameters. */
           total += va_arg (parameters, int);
         }
     
       /* End use of the <code>parameters</code> variable. */
       va_end (parameters);
     
       return total;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>To use optional parameters, you should have a way to know how many
there are.  This can vary, so it can't be hard-coded, but if you
don't know how many optional parameters you have, then you could
have difficulty knowing when to stop using the <code>va_arg</code> function. 
In the above example, the first parameter to the <code>add_multiple_values</code>
function, <code>number</code>, was the number of optional parameters included. 
So, we might call the function like this:

<pre class="example">     sum = add_multiple_values (3, 12, 34, 190);
     </pre>

   <p>The first parameter indicates how many optional parameters follow it.

   <p>Also, note that you don't actually need to use <code>va_end</code> function. 
In fact, in GNU C, it doesn't do anything at all.  However, you might want
to include it for portability to other compilers.

<h3 class="section">The <code>main</code> Function</h3>

<p>Every program requires at least one function, called <code>main</code>. 
This is where the program begins executing.  You do not need to write a
declaration or prototype for <code>main</code>, but you do need to define it.

   <p>The return type for <code>main</code> is always <code>int</code>.  You do not have
to specify the return type for <code>main</code>, but you can.  However, you
<em>cannot</em> specify that it has a return type other than <code>int</code>. 
In general, you want to have <code>main</code> return 0.  Returning other
integers usually indicates that the program ended abnormally.  (You are
not required to explicitly return a value at all.)

   <p>You can write your <code>main</code> function to have no parameters, or to
accept parameters from the command line.  To have no parameters, you can
either specify <code>void</code> as the parameter list, or simply leave it
blank.

   <p>Here is a very simple <code>main</code> function with no parameters:

<pre class="example">     int
     main (void)
     {
       printf ("Hi there!");
       return 0;
     }
     </pre>

   <p>To accept command line parameters, you need to have two parameters in the
<code>main</code> function, <code>int argc</code> followed by <code>char *argv[]</code>.  You
can change the names of those parameters, but they must have those data
types--<code>int</code> and array of pointers to <code>char</code>.  <code>argc</code> is the
number of command line parameters, including the name of the program itself. 
<code>argv</code> is an array of the parameters, as character strings. 
<code>argv[0]</code>, the first element in the array, is the name of the program
as typed at the command line; any following array elements are the
parameters that followed the name of the program.

   <p>Here is an example <code>main</code> function that accepts command line
parameters, and prints out what those parameters are:

<pre class="example">     int
     main (int argc, char *argv[])
     {
       int counter;
     
       for (counter = 0; counter &lt; argc; counter++)
         {
           printf ("%s \n", argv[counter]);
         }
     
       return 0;
     }
     </pre>

<p>You can write a function that is recursive--a function that calls
itself.  Here is an example that computes the factorial of an integer:

<pre class="example">     int
     factorial (int x)
     {
       if (x == 1)
         {
           return x;
         }
       else
         {
           return ( x * factorial (x - 1) );
         }
     }
     </pre>

   <p>Be careful that you do not write a function that is infinitely recursive.  In
the above example, once <code>x</code> is 1, the recursion stops.  However, in the
following example, the recursion (in theory) does not stop:

<pre class="example">     int
     watermelon (int x)
     {
       return ( watermelon (x) );
     }
     </pre>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     </pre>

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     </p><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple <small>HTML</small>,
PostScript or <small>PDF</small> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <small>PNG</small>, <small>XCF</small> and
<small>JPG</small>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <small>SGML</small> or
<small>XML</small> for which the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small>,
PostScript or <small>PDF</small> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     </p><li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     </p><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     </p><li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     </p><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all
sections Entitled "Endorsements."

     </p><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     </p><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     </p><li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     </p><li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     </p><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
     </pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
     </pre>

   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
