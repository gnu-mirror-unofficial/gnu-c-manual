<h4 class="subsection">2.6.2 Initializing Pointers</h4>

<p><a name="index-initializing-pointers-118"></a><a name="index-pointers_002c-initializing-119"></a>
You can initialize a pointer when you first declare it by specifying
a variable address to store in it.  For example, the following code
declares an <code>int</code> variable <span class="samp">i</span>, and a pointer which is
initialized with the address of <span class="samp">i</span>:

<pre class="example">     int i;
     int *ip = &amp;i;
</pre>
   <p>Note the use of the address operator (see <a href="The-Address-Operator.html#The-Address-Operator">The Address Operator</a>), used
to get the memory address of a variable.  <em>Be careful</em>, though:
after you declare a pointer, you do <em>not</em> use the indirection
operator with the pointer's name when assigning it a new address to point
to.  On the contrary, that would change the value of the variable that
the points to, not the value of the pointer itself.  For example:

<pre class="example">     int i, j;
     int *ip = &amp;i;    // <span class="roman">ip now holds the address of i.</span>
     
     ip = &amp;j;         // <span class="roman">ip now holds the address of j.</span>
     
     *ip = &amp;i;        // <span class="roman">j now holds the address of i.</span>
</pre>
   <p>The value stored in a pointer is an integral number: a location within
the computer's memory space.  If you are so inclined, you can assign pointer
values explicitly using literal integers, casting them to the appropriate
pointer type.  However, we do not recommend this practice unless you need
to have extremely fine-tuned control over what is stored in memory, and you
know exactly what you are doing.  It would be all too easy to accidentally
overwrite something that you did not intend to.
