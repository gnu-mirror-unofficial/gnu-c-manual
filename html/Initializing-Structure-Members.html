<h5 class="subsubsection">2.4.2.3 Initializing Structure Members</h5>

<p><a name="index-initializing-structure-members-84"></a><a name="index-structure-members_002c-initializing-85"></a>

   <p>You can initialize the members of a structure type to have certain
values when you declare structure variables.  One way is to specify
the values in a set of braces and separated by commas.  Those values
are assigned to the structure members in the same order that the
members are declared in the structure in definition.

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point = { 5, 10 };
</pre>
   <p>In that example, the <code>x</code> member of <code>first_point</code> gets the
value 5, and the <code>y</code> member gets the value 10.

   <p>Another way to initialize the members is to specify the name of the
member to initialize.  This way, you can initialize the members in
any order you like, and even leave some of them uninitialized.  There
are two methods that you can use&mdash;either follow the member name with
a colon, and then its value, like this:

<pre class="example">     struct point first_point = { y: 10, x: 5 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or precede the member name with a period and assign a value
with the assignment operator, like this:

<pre class="example">     struct point first_point = { .y = 10, .x = 5 };
</pre>
   <p>You can also initialize the structure variable's members when you declare
the variable during the structure definition:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       } first_point = { 5, 10 };
</pre>
   <p>You can also initialize less than all of a structure variable's members:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct point first_point = { 5 };
</pre>
   <p>In that example, only one member, <code>x</code>, is initialized.  <code>y</code> is
left uninitialized.  (This is because the members are initialized in
order of declaration, and <code>x</code> was declared before <code>y</code>.)

   <p>Here is another example that initializes a structure's members which
are structure variables themselves:

<pre class="example">     struct point
       {
         int x, y;
       };
     
     struct rectangle
       {
         struct point top_left, bottom_right;
       };
     
     struct rectangle my_rectangle = { {0, 5}, {10, 0} };
</pre>
   <p>That example defines the <code>rectangle</code> structure to consist of
two <code>point</code> structure variables.  Then it declares one variable
of type <code>struct rectangle</code> and initializes its members.  Since
its members are structure variables, there is an extra set of braces
surrounding the members that belong to the <code>point</code> structure
variables.  However, those extra braces are not necessary; they just
make the code easier to read.
