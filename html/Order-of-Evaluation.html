<h3 class="section">3.5 Order of Evaluation</h3>

<p><a name="index-order-of-evaluation-189"></a><a name="index-evaluation_002c-order-of-190"></a><a name="index-operator-precedence-191"></a><a name="index-precedence_002c-operator-192"></a>
When an expression consists of subexpressions, such as
<code>a + b * f()</code>, the subexpressions are not all evaluated at once,
nor are they necessarily evaluated left to right as they appear in the
expression.  In the preceding example, for instance, the function call
<code>f()</code> will be evaluated first, the result of which will be multiplied
by <code>b</code>, the result of which will be added to <code>a</code>.  That is not
intuitive simply by looking at the expression, but there is a definite
order in which subexpressions are evaluated.

   <p>The following is a list of types of expressions, presented in the same
order that they are evaluated.  The expressions that are evaluated first
are said to have the highest precedence, and those that are evaluated last
the low precedence.  Some types of expressions have the same precedence. 
If two or more subexpressions have the same precedence, then they
are usually evaluated left to right.  If they are <em>not</em> evaluated
left to right, then that is explicitly stated in the list.

<!-- I do not know where the complex conjugation operator belongs -->
<!-- in this list, though this doesn't matter for the C89 material.  -TJR -->
<ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Function calls, array subscripting, and membership access operator
expressions.

     <li>Logical negation, bitwise complement, increment, decrement, unary positive,
unary negative, indirection operator, address operator, type casting, and
<code>sizeof</code> expressions.  When used as subexpressions, these are evaluated
right to left.

     <li>Multiplication, division, and modular division expressions.

     <li>Addition and subtraction expressions.

     <li>Bitwise shifting expressions.

     <li>Greater-than, less-than, greater-than-or-equal-to, and less-than-or-equal-to
expressions.

     <li>Equal-to and not-equal-to expressions.

     <li>Bitwise AND expressions.

     <li>Bitwise exclusive OR expressions.

     <li>Bitwise inclusive OR expressions.

     <li>Logical AND expressions.

     <li>Logical OR expressions.

     <li>Conditional operator expressions (using <code>?:</code>).  When used as
subexpressions, these are evaluated right to left.

     <li>All assignment expressions, including compound assignment.  When multiple
assignment statements appear as subexpressions in a single larger expression,
they are evaluated right to left.

     <li>Comma operator expressions.
