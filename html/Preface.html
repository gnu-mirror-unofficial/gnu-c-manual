NOTE: THIS MANUAL IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED, AND MAY CONTAIN
NON-TRIVIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND INCONSISTENCIES.

   <p>This is a reference manual for the GNU C programming language: the
C programming language as implemented by the GNU C compiler.

   <p>GCC supports several variants of C; this manual aims to explicitly
document three of them:

     <ul>
<li>The original 1989 ANSI C standard, commonly known as &ldquo;C89&rdquo;
<li>The revised 1999 ISO C standard, commonly known as &ldquo;C99&rdquo;
<li>The current state of GNU extensions to standard C

   </ul>

   <p>By default, GCC will compile code as C89 plus GNU-specific extensions.  Much
of C99 is supported; once full support is available, the default compilation
dialect will be C99 plus GNU-specific extensions.  (Note that some of the
GNU extensions to C89 found ended up, sometimes slightly modified, as standard
language features in C99.)

<!-- Except as specified, this manual describes C89.  Language features that are -->
<!-- available only in C99 or as a GNU extension are labelled as such. -->
<p>Presently, this manual describes C89 only.  Descriptions of C99 and GNU extensions
will be included in future releases, labelled as such along side the original
C89 material.  While most users of GCC are free to use the latest and greatest
additions to the compiler, some users must continue to use older versions of
GCC.  (For example, avionics programmers cannot switch to newer compilers on
a whim, and indeed often use the same compiler for years until a new version
is approved for use.)  For this reason, we feel that a clear distinction
between C dialects will be useful to our readers.

   <p>The C language includes a set of preprocessor directives, which are used for
things such as macro text replacement, conditional compilation, and file
inclusion.  Although normally described in a C language manual, the GNU C
preprocessor has been thoroughly documented in <cite>The C Preprocessor</cite>,
a separate manual which covers preprocessing for C, C++, and Objective C programs.

   <p>Most of this manual was written by Trevis J. Rothwell, with contributions from
Dr. Richard M. Stallman.

   <p>Other people have also contributed to this manual, either by way of editing,
proofreading, making suggestions, fixing typesetting problems, and/or
helping with administrative details.  These individuals include:
Robert J. Chassell, Lisa Goldstein, Robert J. Hansen, Joe Humphries,
J. Wren Hunt, Steve Morningthunder, and Ole J. Tetlie.

   <p>This manual is (still) in progress; please feel free to send comments
to Trevis Rothwell via email.
