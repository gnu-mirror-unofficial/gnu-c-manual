<h3 class="section">6.1 Program Structure</h3>

<p><a name="index-program-structure-238"></a><a name="index-structure_002c-program-239"></a>
A C program may exist entirely within a single source file, but more commonly, any non-trivial
program will consist of several custom header files and source files, and will also include
and link with files from existing libraries.

   <p>In general, header files (with a &ldquo;.h&rdquo; extension) store variable and function declarations,
and source files (with a &ldquo;.c&rdquo; extension) store the corresponding definitions.  Source files
may also store declarations, if these declarations are not for objects which need to be seen by
other files.  However, header files almost certainly should not store any definitions.

   <p>For example, if you write a function that computes square roots, and you wanted this function
to be accessible to files other than where you define the function, then you would put the
function declaration into a header file (with a &ldquo;.h&rdquo; file extension):

<pre class="example">     /* <span class="roman">sqrt.h</span> */
     
     float computeSqrt (float x);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This header file could be included by other source files which need to use your function,
but do not need to know how it was implemented.

   <p>The implementation of the function would then go into a corresponding source file
(with a &ldquo;.c&rdquo; file extension):

<pre class="example">     /* <span class="roman">sqrt.c</span> */
     #include "sqrt.h"
     
     float computeSqrt (float x)
     {
       float result;
       ...
       return result;
     }
</pre>
   </body></html>
