<h2>The GNU C Reference Manual</h2>

<p>
<i>The GNU C Reference Manual</i> is a reference for the C programming
language, as implemented by the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C
Compiler</a>.</p>


<p>
This manual is strictly a reference, not a tutorial.  Its aim is to cover every
linguistic construct in GNU C, but not the library functions (which are documented
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/">elsewhere</a>).  
This manual would probably not make a good
introductory book for new programmers, although those who know languages
other than C should be able to learn C using it.</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-c-manual/">v0.2.4 release</a>
of the manual is now available, which includes a number of corrections
suggested by readers.  If you don't feel like building the manual from
the Texinfo source, you can also read
an <a href="gnu-c-manual.html">HTML version</a> or a
<a href="gnu-c-manual.pdf">PDF version</a> of the manual.</p>

<p>
For additional information, please see the manual's
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnu-c-manual/">project
page</a> at Savannah.

     files generated as part of manuals) on the GNU web server should
     be under CC BY-ND 4.0.  Please do NOT change or remove this
     without talking with the webmasters or licensing team first.
     Please make sure the copyright date is consistent with the
     document.  For web pages, it is ok to list just the latest year the
     document was modified, or published.
     
     If you wish to list earlier years, that is ok too.
     Either "2001, 2002, 2003" or "2001-2003" are ok for specifying
     years, as long as each year in the range is in fact a copyrightable
     year, i.e., a year in which the document was published (including
     being publicly visible on the web or in a revision control system).
     
     There is more detail about copyright years in the GNU Maintainers
     Information document, www.gnu.org/prep/maintain. -->
