<h2>The GNU C Reference Manual</h2>

<img src="http://www.trevisrothwell.com/gnu/images/gnu1ink_1.jpg" width=200 align="left">

<p>
<i>The GNU C Reference Manual</i> is a reference for the C programming
language, as implemented by the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C
Compiler</a>.  This manual is currently a work in progress.


<h3>What Is the Scope of the Manual?</h3>

<p>
It is a reference, and not a tutorial.  Its aim is to cover every linguistic
construct in GNU C, but not the library functions.  (Those are described in a
separate set of manuals.)  This manual would probably not make a good
introductory book for new programmers, although those who know languages
other than C should be able to learn C using it.

<h3>Can I Read the Manual Now?</h3>

<p>
You can read a recent draft of the manual in
<a href="gnu-c-manual.html">HTML format</a>.  Remember, this is not
complete yet, and there could be nontrivial mistakes and/or omissions!
(If you happen to find any mistakes or omissions, feel free to send a note
to <a href="mailto:gnu-c-manual@gnu.org">gnu-c-manual@gnu.org</a>.)

<h3>Plan to Completion</h3>

<p>
<b>Update 27 August 2007</b>: a candidate for Release 0.1 of the GNU
C Reference Manual is now complete!  The goal for Release 0.1 is to
completely document the C89 language, as a baseline atop which to
add documentation of new C99 features and GNU extensions.  We will
continue to read over this material and make corrections as necessary,
but a formal 0.1 release of the manual should be forthcoming soon...

<p>
The <a href="http://www.trevisrothwell.com/">project maintainer</a> is
planning some formal "prereleases" of this manual, in hopes of making
completion a more attainable goal rather than an idle dream.  To that
end, you can expect the following:

<ul>
<li>Release 0.1 - coverage of C89 syntax</li>
<li>Release 0.2 - any needed corrections from 0.1, plus coverage of C99</li>
<li>Release 0.3 - any needed corrections from 0.2, plus coverage of GNU extensions</li>
<li>Release 1.0 - any needed corrections from 0.3</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since GCC supports C89, C99, and full GNU C, it seems worthwhile to document
all three of those dialects within the GNU C manual.  Most of the language is identical
across these dialects, but the manual will denote the differences.

<p>
Release 0.1 should happen within the first quarter of calendar year 2007.  The
remaining three releases will hopefully occur in the subsequent quarters of 2007, but
may happen sooner or later than that.  More details to follow.

<p>
[Well, obviously, these dates weren't hit, but progress is still being made...]
